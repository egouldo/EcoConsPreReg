# Adaptive Preregistration for Model-Based Research

## About

This repository provides the source-code for [a practical guide to implementing _Adaptive Preregistration for Model-Based Research](https://egouldo.github.io/EcoConsPreReg/) that accompanies the paper:

> Gould, E., Jones, C.S., Yen, J.D.L., Fraser, H.F., Wootton, H., Vivian, L., Good, M., Duncan, D.H., Rumpff, L., Fidler, F.M., _et al._ (in prep., 2024) "But I can't preregister my research: Improving the reproducibility and transparency of ecological modelling with adaptive preregistration. 

The guide provides background on researcher degrees of freedom and the risk of quesitonable research practices in model-based research, and argues for the role in preregistration for improving the replicability and transparency of ecological modelling. The main components of the guide include an overview of adaptive preregistration, and a practical guide on implementing it using _git_ and _GitHub_.
