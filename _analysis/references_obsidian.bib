  abstract = {The effectiveness of conservation efforts ultimately depends on the recognition that decision making, and the systems that it is designed to affect, are inherently dynamic and characterized by multiple sources of uncertainty. To cope with these challenges, conservation planners are increasingly turning to the tools of decision analysis, especially dynamic optimization methods. Here we provide a general framework for optimal, dynamic conservation and then explore its capacity for coping with various sources and degrees of uncertainty. In broadest terms, the dynamic optimization problem in conservation is choosing among a set of decision options at periodic intervals so as to maximize some conservation objective over the planning horizon. Planners must account for immediate objective returns, as well as the effect of current decisions on future resource conditions and, thus, on future decisions. Undermining the effectiveness of such a planning process are uncertainties concerning extant resource conditions (partial observability), the immediate consequences of decision choices (partial controllability), the outcomes of uncontrolled, environmental drivers (environmental variation), and the processes structuring resource dynamics (structural uncertainty). Where outcomes from these sources of uncertainty can be described in terms of probability distributions, a focus on maximizing the expected objective return, while taking state-specific actions, is an effective mechanism for coping with uncertainty. When such probability distributions are unavailable or deemed unreliable, a focus on maximizing robustness is likely to be the preferred approach. Here the idea is to choose an action (or state-dependent policy) that achieves at least some minimum level of performance regardless of the (uncertain) outcomes. We provide some examples of how the dynamic optimization problem can be framed for problems involving management of habitat for an imperiled species, conservation of a critically endangered population through captive breeding, control of invasive species, construction of biodiversity reserves, design of landscapes to increase habitat connectivity, and resource exploitation. Although these decision making problems and their solutions present significant challenges, we suggest that a systematic and effective approach to dynamic decision making in conservation need not be an onerous undertaking. The requirements are shared with any systematic approach to decision making---a careful consideration of values, actions, and outcomes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}High spatial resolution (1--5 m) remotely sensed datasets are increasingly being used to map land covers over large geographic areas using supervised machine learning algorithms. Although many studies have compared machine learning classification methods, sample selection methods for acquiring training and validation data for machine learning, and cross-validation techniques for tuning classifier parameters are rarely investigated, particularly on large, high spatial resolution datasets. This work, therefore, examines four sample selection methods---simple random, proportional stratified random, disproportional stratified random, and deliberative sampling---as well as three cross-validation tuning approaches---k-fold, leave-one-out, and Monte Carlo methods. In addition, the effect on the accuracy of localizing sample selections to a small geographic subset of the entire area, an approach that is sometimes used to reduce costs associated with training data collection, is investigated. These methods are investigated in the context of support vector machines (SVM) classification and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), using high spatial resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) orthoimagery and LIDAR-derived rasters, covering a 2,609 km2 regional-scale area in northeastern West Virginia, USA. Stratified-statistical-based sampling methods were found to generate the highest classification accuracy. Using a small number of training samples collected from only a subset of the study area provided a similar level of overall accuracy to a sample of equivalent size collected in a dispersed manner across the entire regional-scale dataset. There were minimal differences in accuracy for the different cross-validation tuning methods. The processing time for Monte Carlo and leave-one-out cross-validation were high, especially with large training sets. For this reason, k-fold cross-validation appears to be a good choice. Classifications trained with samples collected deliberately (i.e., not randomly) were less accurate than classifiers trained from statistical-based samples. This may be due to the high positive spatial autocorrelation in the deliberative training set. Thus, if possible, samples for training should be selected randomly; deliberative samples should be avoided.},

  volume = {349(6251)},
  publisher = {American Association for the Advancement of Science},
  abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textbackslash}\&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47{\textbackslash}\% of original effect sizes were in the 95{\textbackslash}\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39{\textbackslash}\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68{\textbackslash}\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that {\textbackslash}textquotedblleftwe already know this{\textbackslash}textquotedblright belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original.

We devised a novel approach for selecting cost-effective areas for restoration on the basis of biodiversity and potential provision of 3 ecosystem services: carbon storage, water depuration, and coastal protection. We used Marxan, a spatial prioritization tool, to balance the provision of ecosystem services against the cost of restoration. We tested this approach in a mangrove ecosystem in the Caribbean. Our approach efficiently selected restoration areas that at low cost were compatible with biodiversity targets and that maximized the provision of one or more ecosystem services. Choosing areas for restoration of mangroves on the basis carbon storage potential, largely guaranteed the restoration of biodiversity and other ecosystem services.

We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in new cases (-3.55 per 100K), deaths (-0.13 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.38 percentage points) up to 40 days after the introduction of mask mandates both at the state and county level. These effects are large, corresponding to 14\% of the highest recorded number of cases, 13\% of deaths, and 7\% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states. Given the recent lifting of mandates, we estimate that the ending of mask mandates in these states is associated with a decrease of -3.19 percentage points in mask adherence and 12 per 100K (13\% of the highest recorded number) of daily new cases with no significant effect on hospitalizations and deaths. Lastly, using a large novel survey dataset of 847 thousand responses in 69 countries, we introduce the novel results that community mask adherence and community attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results have policy implications for reinforcing the need to maintain and encourage mask-wearing by the public, especially in light of some states starting to remove their mask mandates.},

Although recent meta-analyses questioned the generality of hump-shaped patterns, these syntheses have been criticized for failing to account for methodological differences among studies. We addressed such concerns by conducting standardized sampling in 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities on five continents. We found no clear relationship between productivity and fine-scale (meters{$^{-2}$}) richness within sites, within regions, or across the globe. Ecologists should focus on fresh, mechanistic approaches to understanding the multivariate links between productivity and richness.},

  abstract = {Conducting literature reviews for scientific papers is essential for understanding research, its limitations, and building on existing work. It is a tedious task which makes an automatic literature review generator appealing. Unfortunately, many existing works that generate such reviews using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant limitations. They tend to hallucinate-generate non-actual information-and ignore the latest research they have not been trained on. To address these limitations, we propose a toolkit that operates on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, specialized prompting and instructing techniques with the help of LLMs. Our system first initiates a web search to retrieve relevant papers by summarizing user-provided abstracts into keywords using an off-the-shelf LLM. Authors can enhance the search by supplementing it with relevant papers or keywords, contributing to a tailored retrieval process. Second, the system re-ranks the retrieved papers based on the user-provided abstract. Finally, the related work section is generated based on the re-ranked results and the abstract. There is a substantial reduction in time and effort for literature review compared to traditional methods, establishing our toolkit as an efficient alternative. Our open-source toolkit is accessible at https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/LitLLM and Huggingface space (https://huggingface.co/spaces/shubhamagarwal92/LitLLM) with the video demo at https://youtu.be/E2ggOZBAFw0.},

  abstract = {A survey in the United States revealed that an alarmingly large percentage of university psychologists admitted having used questionable research practices that can contaminate the research literature with false positive and biased findings. We conducted a replication of this study among Italian research psychologists to investigate whether these findings generalize to other countries. All the original materials were translated into Italian, and members of the Italian Association of Psychology were invited to participate via an online survey. The percentages of Italian psychologists who admitted to having used ten questionable research practices were similar to the results obtained in the United States although there were small but significant differences in self-admission rates for some QRPs. Nearly all researchers (88\%) admitted using at least one of the practices, and researchers generally considered a practice possibly defensible if they admitted using it, but Italian researchers were much less likely than US researchers to consider a practice defensible. Participants' estimates of the percentage of researchers who have used these practices were greater than the self-admission rates, and participants estimated that researchers would be unlikely to admit it. In written responses, participants argued that some of these practices are not questionable and they have used some practices because reviewers and journals demand it. The similarity of results obtained in the United States, this study, and a related study conducted in Germany suggest that adoption of these practices is an international phenomenon and is likely due to systemic features of the international research and publication processes.},

The SCORE program is creating and validating algorithms to provide confidence scores for research claims at scale. To investigate the viability of scalable tools, teams are creating: a database of claims from papers in the social and behavioral sciences; expert and machine generated estimates of credibility; and, evidence of reproducibility, robustness, and replicability to validate the estimates.

Over 1.8 billion people live on these lands so responses that promote agency, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million km{$<$}jats:sup{$>$}2{$<$}/jats:sup{$>$} of land requiring conservation could be lost to intensive human land-uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, there is a seven-fold difference between the amount of habitat converted under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis. Appropriate targets in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to ensure conservation of the identified land would contribute substantially to safeguarding biodiversity.},

With data from four large-scale replication projects in experimental psychology and economics, and techniques from machine learning, we train predictive models and study which variables drive predictable replication. The models predicts binary replication with a cross-validated accuracy rate of 70\% (AUC of 0.77) and estimates of relative effect sizes with a Spearman {$\rho$} of 0.38. The accuracy level is similar to market-aggregated beliefs of peer scientists [1, 2]. The predictive power is validated in a pre-registered out of sample test of the outcome of [3], where 71\% (AUC of 0.73) of replications are predicted correctly and effect size correlations amount to {$\rho$} = 0.25. Basic features such as the sample and effect sizes in original papers, and whether reported effects are single-variable main effects or two-variable interactions, are predictive of successful replication. The models presented in this paper are simple tools to produce cheap, prognostic replicability metrics. These models could be useful in institutionalizing the process of evaluation of new findings and guiding resources to those direct replications that are likely to be most informative.},

Over the last 10 years, the number of marine SCP studies has increased exponentially, yet there is no structured or reliable way to find information on methods, trends, and progress. The rapid growth in methods and marine applications warrants an updated analysis of the literature, as well as reflection on the need for continuous and systematic documentation of SCP exercises in general. To address these gaps, we developed a database to document SCP exercises and populated it with 155 marine SCP exercises found in the primary literature. Based on our review, we provide an update on global advances and trends in marine SCP literature. We found accelerating growth in the number of studies over the past decade, with increasing consideration of socioeconomic variables, land-sea planning, and ecological connectivity. While several studies aimed to inform conservation decisions, we found little evidence of input from practitioners. There are important gaps in geographic coverage and little correspondence with areas most threatened. Five countries lead most studies, but their networks suggest potential for capacity building through collaborations. The varying quality and detail in documentation of studies confirmed the limited opportunities to develop and assess the application of best practice in conservation planning. A global database to track the development, implementation, and impact of SCP applications can thus provide numerous benefits. Our data- base constitutes an important step towards the development of a centralized repository of information on planning exercises and can serve several roles to advance SCP theory and practice: it facilitates assessing geo- graphic coverage and gaps; scientists and practitioners can access information to identify trends in the use of data, methods, and tools; reviewers and editors of journals can assess whether studies have covered important literature and developments; donors and non-government organizations can identify regions needing further work; and practitioners and policy-makers can learn from previous plans.},

Our paper presents a review of the key arguments in favor and against explainability for AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) applied to a concrete use case, namely an AI-powered CDSS currently used in the emergency call setting to identify patients with life-threatening cardiac arrest. More specifically, we performed a normative analysis using socio-technical scenarios to provide a nuanced account of the role of explainability for CDSSs for the concrete use case, allowing for abstractions to a more general level. Our analysis focused on three layers: technical considerations, human factors, and the designated system role in decision-making. Our findings suggest that whether explainability can provide added value to CDSS depends on several key questions: technical feasibility, the level of validation in case of explainable algorithms, the characteristics of the context in which the system is implemented, the designated role in the decision-making process, and the key user group(s).

Under the decision maker's approximating model, cautious behavior puts adjust- ments for model misspecification into market prices for risk factors. We use a statistical theory of detection to quantify how much model misspecification the decision maker should fear, given his historical data record. A semigroup is a collection of objects connected by something like the law of iterated expectations. The law of iterated expectations defines the semigroup for a Markov process, while similar laws define other semigroups. Related semigroups describe (1) an approximating model; (2) a model misspecification adjustment to the continuation value in the decision maker's Bellman equation; (3) asset prices; and (4) the behavior of the model detection statistics that we use to calibrate how much robustness the decision maker prefers. Semigroups 2, 3, and 4 establish a tight link between the market price of uncertainty and a bound on the error in statistically discriminating between an approxi- mating and a worst case model.

The drat package facilitates creation and use of such alternative repositories and makes it particularly simple to host them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on packages posted to drat repositories through the use of the 'Additonal\_repositories' field in the DESCRIPTION file.

  abstract = {Developing tools to predict the location of new biological invasions is essential if exotic species are to be controlled before they become widespread. Currently, alpine areas in Australia are largely free of exotic plant species but face increasing pressure from invasive species due to global warming and intensified human use. To predict the potential spread of highly invasive orange hawkweed (Hieracium aurantiacum) from existing founder populations on the Bogong High Plains in southern Australia, we developed an expert-based, spatially explicit, dispersal-constrained, habitat suitability model. The model combines a habitat suitability index, developed from disturbance, site wetness, and vegetation community parameters, with a phenomenological dispersal kernel that uses wind direction and observed dispersal distances. After generating risk maps that defined the relative suitability of H. aurantiacum establishment across the study area, we intensively searched several locations to evaluate the model. The highest relative suitability for H. aurantiacum establishment was southeast from the initial infestations. Native tussock grasslands and disturbed areas had high suitability for H. aurantiacum establishment. Extensive field searches failed to detect new populations. Time-step evaluation using the location of populations known in 1998-2000, accurately assigned high relative suitability for locations where H. aurantiacum had established post-2003 (AUC [area under curve] = 0.855 +/- 0.035). This suggests our model has good predictive power and will improve the ability to detect populations and prioritize areas for ongoing monitoring.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in ``established use.'' Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

In this article, we investigate their potential for exploring different perspectives in trade disputes. To do so, we draw on a specific case study that was arbitrated by the World Trade Organization (WTO): the Australia-New Zealand apples dispute. The dispute centered on disagreement about judgments contained within Australia's 2006 import risk analysis (IRA). We built a range of BNs of increasing com- plexity that modeled various approaches to undertaking IRAs, from the basic qualitative and semi-quantitative risk analyses routinely performed in government agencies, to the more complex quantitative simulation undertaken by Australia in the apples dispute. We found the BNs useful for exploring disagreements under uncertainty because they are probabilistic and transparently represent steps in the analysis. Different scenarios and evidence can easily be entered. Specifically, we explore the sensitivity of the risk output to different judgments (particularly volume of trade). Thus, we explore how BNs could usefully aid WTO dispute settlement. We conclude that BNs are preferable to basic qualitative and semi-quantitative risk analyses because they offer an accessible interface and are mathematically sound. How- ever, most current BN modeling tools are limited compared with complex simulations, as was used in the 2006 apples IRA. Although complex simulations may be more accurate, they are a black box for stakeholders. BNs have the potential to be a transparent aid to complex de- cision making, but they are currently computationally limited. Recent technological software developments are promising.},

Such practices include design, analytic, or reporting practices that may introduce biased evidence, which can have harmful implications for evidence-based practice, theory development, and perceptions of the rigor of science. Design/Methodology/Approach To assess the extent to which QRPs are actually a concern, we conducted a sys- tematic review to consider the evidence on QRPs. Using a triangulation approach (e.g., by reviewing data from observations, sensitivity analyses, and surveys), we iden- tified the good, the bad, and the ugly. Findings Of the 64 studies that fit our criteria, 6 appeared to find little to no evidence of engagement in QRPs and the other 58 found more severe evidence (91 \%). Implications Drawing upon the findings, we provide rec- ommendations for future research related to publication practices and academic training. Originality/value We report findings from studies that suggest that QRPs are not a problem, that QRPs are used at a suboptimal rate, and that QRPs present a threat to the viability of organizational science research.},

Whereas the introduction of network theory has enabled ecologists to quantify not only the degree, but also the architecture of ecological com- plexity, these advances have come at the cost of introducing new challenges, including new theoretical con- cepts and metrics, and increased data complexity and computational intensity. Synthesizing recent developments in the network ecology literature, we point to several potential solutions to these issues: inte- grating network metrics and their terminology across sub-disciplines; benchmarking new network algo- rithms and models to increase mechanistic understanding; and improving tools for sharing ecological network research, in particular ``model'' data provenance, to increase the reproducibility of network mod- els and analyses. We propose that applying these solutions will aid in synthesizing ecological sub-disci- plines and allied fields by improving the accessibility of network methods and models.},

To help remedy this situation in the context of species distribution modeling, we created Wallace, an open and modular application with a richly documented GUI with underlying R scripts that is flexible and highly interactive. 3. Wallace guides users from acquiring and processing data to building models and examining predictions. Additionally, it is designed to grow via community contribu- tions of new modules to expand functionality. All results are downloadable, along with code to reproduce the analysis. 4. Wallace provides an example of an innovative platform to increase access to cutting-edge methods and encourage plurality in science and collaboration in soft- ware development.},

Our study focuses on how ChatGPT can be used to support the literature review process for undergraduate students conducting research for their capstone courses. Furthermore, we will explore the possible drawbacks and limitations of relying on artificial intelligence to perform such research tasks. The aim is to provide a balanced and comprehensive view of the role and future potential of AI, and specifically ChatGPT, in literature review studies. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and relevance of the results generated by ChatGPT, we will also examine the quality of results generated by ChatGPT.},

We propose a set of best-practice standards and detailed guidelines enabling scoring of studies based on species distribution models for use in biodiversity assessments. We reviewed and scored 400 modeling studies over the past 20 years using the proposed standards and guidelines. We detected low model adequacy overall, but with a marked tendency of improvement over time in model building and, to a lesser degree, in biological data and model evaluation. We argue that implementation of agreed-upon standards for models in biodiversity assessments would promote transparency and repeatability, eventually leading to higher quality of the models and the inferences used in assessments. We encourage broad community participation toward the expansion and ongoing development of the proposed standards and guidelines.}

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse soft- ware tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for per- forming comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

By integrating a web-based application programming interface for the statistical programming language R via OpenCPU, formr allows researchers to use a familiar programming language to enable complex features. These can range from adaptive testing, to graphical and interactive feedback, to integration with non-survey data sources such as self-trackers or online social network data. Here we showcase three studies created in formr: a study of couples with dyadic feedback; a longitudinal study over months, which included social networks and peer and partner ratings; and a diary study with daily invitations sent out by text message and email and extensive feedback on intraindividual patterns.},

  abstract = {Data documentation in psychology lags behind not only many other disciplines, but also basic standards of usefulness. Psychological scientists often prefer to invest the time and effort that would be necessary to document existing data well in other duties, such as writing and collecting more data. Codebooks therefore tend to be unstandardized and stored in proprietary formats, and they are rarely properly indexed in search engines. This means that rich data sets are sometimes used only once---by their creators---and left to disappear into oblivion. Even if they can find an existing data set, researchers are unlikely to publish analyses based on it if they cannot be confident that they understand it well enough. My codebook package makes it easier to generate rich metadata in human- and machine-readable codebooks. It uses metadata from existing sources and automates some tedious tasks, such as documenting psychological scales and reliabilities, summarizing descriptive statistics, and identifying patterns of missingness. The codebook R package and Web app make it possible to generate a rich codebook in a few minutes and just three clicks. Over time, its use could lead to psychological data becoming findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, thereby reducing research waste and benefiting both its users and the scientific community as a whole.},

  abstract = {Confusion about model validation is one of the main challenges in using ecological models for decision support, such as the regulation of pesticides. Decision makers need to know whether a model is a suffi- ciently good representation of its real counterpart and what criteria can be used to answer this question. Unclear terminology is one of the main obstacles to a good understanding of what model validation is, how it works, and what it can deliver. Therefore, we performed a literature review and derived a standard set of terms. `Validation' was identified as a catch-all term, which is thus useless for any practical pur- pose. We introduce the term `evaludation', a fusion of `evaluation' and `validation', to describe the entire process of assessing a model's quality and reliability. Considering the iterative nature of model develop- ment, the modelling cycle, we identified six essential elements of evaludation: (i) `data evaluation' for scrutinising the quality of numerical and qualitative data used for model development and testing; (ii) `conceptual model evaluation' for examining the simplifying assumptions underlying a model's design; (iii) `implementation verification' for testing the model's implementation in equations and as a computer programme; (iv) `model output verification' for comparing model output to data and patterns that guided model design and were possibly used for calibration; (v) `model analysis' for exploring the model's sensi- tivity to changes in parameters and process formulations to make sure that the mechanistic basis of main behaviours of the model has been well understood; and (vi) `model output corroboration' for comparing model output to new data and patterns that were not used for model development and parameterisation. Currently, most decision makers require `validating' a model by testing its predictions with new exper- iments or data. Despite being desirable, this is neither sufficient nor necessary for a model to be useful for decision support. We believe that the proposed set of terms and its relation to the modelling cycle can help to make quality assessments and reality checks of ecological models more comprehensive and transparent.},

  abstract = {Researchers face many, often seemingly arbitrary choices in formulating hypotheses, designing protocols, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results. Opportunistic use of `researcher degrees of freedom' aimed at obtaining statistical significance increases the likelihood of obtaining and publishing false positive results and overestimated effect sizes. Preregistration is a mechanism for reducing such degrees of freedom by specifying designs and analysis plans before observing the research outcomes. The effectiveness of preregistration may depend, in part, on whether the process facilitates sufficiently specific articulation of such plans. In this preregistered study, we compared two formats of preregistration available on the OSF: Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration and Prereg Challenge registration (now called ``OSF Preregistration'', http://osf.io/prereg/). The Prereg Challenge format was a structured workflow with detailed instructions, and an independent review to confirm completeness; the ``Standard'' format was unstructured with minimal direct guidance to give researchers flexibility for what to pre-specify. Results of comparing random samples of 53 preregistrations from each format indicate that the structured format restricted the opportunistic use of researcher degrees of freedom better (Cliff's Delta = 0.49) than the unstructured format, but neither eliminated all researcher degrees of freedom. We also observed very low concordance among coders about the number of hypotheses (14\%), indicating that they are often not clearly stated. We conclude that effective preregistration is challenging, and registration formats that provide effective guidance may improve the quality of research.},

However, researcher biases can lead to questionable research practices in secondary data analysis, which can distort the evidence base. While pre-registration can help to protect against researcher biases, it presents challenges for secondary data analysis. In this article, we describe these challenges and propose novel solutions and alternative approaches. Proposed solutions include approaches to (1) address bias linked to prior knowledge of the data, (2) enable pre-registration of non-hypothesis-driven research, (3) help ensure that pre-registered analyses will be appropriate for the data, and (4) address difficulties arising from reduced analytic flexibility in pre-registration. For each solution, we provide guidance on implementation for researchers and data guardians. The adoption of these practices can help to protect against researcher bias in secondary data analysis, to improve the robustness of research based on existing data.},

We report the development of continuous analysis, a workflow that enables reproducible computational analyses. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container technology akin to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a software development technique, to automatically rerun a computational analysis whenever updates or improvements are made to source code or data. This enables researchers to reproduce results without contacting the study authors. Continuous analysis allows reviewers, editors or readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning code and can provide an audit trail for analyses of data that cannot be shared.},

However, widespread adoption has yet to gain traction for the development and application of bioassessment products. At the core of this philosophy is the concept that research should be reproducible and transparent, in addition to having long-term value through effective data preservation and sharing. In this article, we review core open science concepts that have recently been adopted in the ecological sciences and emphasize how adoption can benefit the field of bioassessment for both prescriptive condition assessments and proactive applications that inform environmental management. An example from the state of California demonstrates effective adoption of open science principles through data stewardship, reproducible research, and engagement of stakeholders with multimedia applications. We also discuss technical, sociocultural, and institutional challenges for adopting open science, including practical approaches for overcoming these hurdles in bioassessment applications.},

  abstract = {Background: Modelling studies are used widely to help inform decisions about health care and policy and their use is increasing. However, in order for modelling to gain strength as a tool for health policy, it is critical that key model factors are transparent so that users of models can have a clear understanding of the model and its limitations.Reporting guidelines are evidence-based tools that specify minimum criteria for authors to report their research such that readers can both critically appraise and interpret study findings. This study was conducted to determine whether there is an unmet need for population modelling reporting guidelines. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature to identify: 1) guidance for reporting population modelling studies; and, 2) evidence on the quality of reporting of population modelling studies. Guidance for reporting was analysed using a thematic approach and the data was summarised as frequencies. Evidence on the quality of reporting was reviewed and summarized descriptively. Results: There were no guidelines that specifically addressed the reporting of population modelling studies. We identified a number of reporting guidelines for economic evaluation studies, some of which had sections that were relevant population modelling studies. Amongst seven relevant records, we identified 69 quality criteria that have distinct reporting characteristics. We identified two papers that addressed reporting practices of modelling studies. Overall, with the exception of describing the data used for calibration, there was little consistency in reporting. Conclusions: While numerous guidelines exist for developing and evaluating health technology assessment and economic evaluation models, which by extension could be applicable to population modelling studies, there is variation in their comprehensiveness and in the consistency of reporting these methods. Population modelling studies may be an area which would benefit from the development of a reporting guideline.},

While generally considered the most valid way to produce data, this expert-driven process is inherently difficult to replicate or to assess on grounds of reliability. Using crowd-sourcing to distribute text for reading and interpretation by massive numbers of nonexperts, we generate results comparable to those using experts to read and interpret the same texts, but do so far more quickly and flexibly. Crucially, the data we collect can be reproduced and extended transparently, making crowd-sourced datasets intrinsically reproducible. This focuses researchers' attention on the fundamental scientific objective of specifying reliable and replicable methods for collecting the data needed, rather than on the content of any particular dataset. We also show that our approach works straightforwardly with different types of political text, written in different languages. While findings reported here concern text analysis, they have far-reaching implications for expert-generated data in the social sciences.},

  abstract = {A paradigm shift away from null hypothesis significance testing seems in progress. Based on simulations, we illustrate some of the underlying motivations. First, p-values vary strongly from study to study, hence dichotomous inference using significance thresholds is usually unjustified. Second, 'statistically significant' results have overestimated effect sizes, a bias declining with increasing statistical power. Third, 'statistically non-significant' results have underestimated effect sizes, and this bias gets stronger with higher statistical power. Fourth, the tested statistical hypotheses usually lack biological justification and are often uninformative. Despite these problems, a screen of 48 papers from the 2020 volume of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology exemplifies that significance testing is still used almost universally in evolutionary biology. All screened studies tested default null hypotheses of zero effect with the default significance threshold of p~=~0.05, none presented a pre-specified alternative hypothesis, pre-study power calculation and the probability of 'false negatives' (beta error rate). The results sections of the papers presented 49~significance tests on average (median 23, range 0-390). Of 41~studies that contained verbal descriptions of a 'statistically non-significant' result, 26 (63\%) falsely claimed the absence of an effect. We conclude that studies in ecology and evolutionary biology are mostly exploratory and descriptive. We should thus shift from claiming to 'test' specific hypotheses statistically to describing and discussing many hypotheses (possible true effect sizes) that are most compatible with our data, given our statistical model. We already have the means for doing so, because we routinely present compatibility ('confidence') intervals covering these hypotheses.},

  abstract = {We offer a new model of the sensemaking process for data science and visual analytics. Whereas past sensemaking models have been built on theoretical foundations in cognitivism and positivism, this model adopts interpretivist foundations in order to reframe data sensemaking in humanistic terms. We identify five key principles centered on the concept of schemas: Tacit and Explicit Schemas, Schemas First and Always, Data as a Schematic Artifact, Schematic Multiplicity, and Sensemaking Over Time. Our model uses the analogy of an iceberg, where data is the visible tip of the schema underneath it. The analysis process iteratively refines both the data and its schema in tandem. We compare the roles of schemas in past sensemaking models and draw conceptual distinctions based on a historical review of schemas in different philosophical traditions. We validate the descriptive, predictive, and explanatory power of our model through four analysis scenarios: uncovering data injustice, investigating official data, teaching data wrangling, and producing data mashups.},

This study attempted to determine the percentage of published papers that contain inappropriate image duplication, a specific type of inaccurate data. The images from a total of 20,621 papers published in 40 scientific journals from 1995 to 2014 were visually screened. Overall, 3.8\% of published papers contained problematic figures, with at least half exhibiting features suggestive of deliberate manipulation. The prevalence of papers with problematic images has risen markedly during the past decade. Additional papers written by authors of papers with problematic images had an increased likelihood of containing problematic images as well. As this analysis focused only on one type of data, it is likely that the actual prevalence of inaccurate data in the published literature is higher. The marked variation in the frequency of problematic images among journals suggests that journal practices, such as prepublication image screening, influence the quality of the scientific literature.},

However, the approaches to modelling used in the past have led to problems, such as modellers having difficulty establishing the credibility of their model with stakeholders, and stakeholders having difficulty understanding and trusting model results. A best practice approach to the implementation and application of water resources management models based on a quality assurance procedure is an appropriate means of overcoming these difficulties, and there are a number of guidelines and papers available promoting this approach. However, guidance in these on the use of models to analyse water resource planning scenarios is limited or not provided. This paper therefore provides guidance on the implementation and application of water resources manage- ment models with an emphasis on scenario analysis. This guidance is principally intended for practising modellers, and also for peer reviewers and stakeholders such as managers, decision makers, and community-based groups. Adoption strategies and recommendations for future directions are also discussed.},

Resource users respond by seeking to replace some or all of the lost resources from locations elsewhere in the landscape. Protected area networks thereby perturb the pattern of human pressures by displacing extractive effort from within protected areas into the broader landscape, a process known as leakage. The negative effects of leakage on conservation outcomes have been empirically documented and modeled using homogeneous descriptions of conservation landscapes. Human resource use and biodiversity vary greatly in space, however, and a theory of leakage must describe how this heterogeneity affects the magnitude, pattern, and biodiversity impacts of leakage. We combined models of household utility, adaptive human foraging, and biodiversity conservation to provide a bioeconomic model of leakage that accounts for spatial heterogeneity. Leakage had strong and divergent impacts on the performance of protected area networks, undermining biodiversity benefits but mitigating the negative impacts on local resource users. When leakage was present, our model showed that poorly designed protected area networks resulted in a substantial net loss of biodiversity. However, the effects of leakage can be mitigated if they are incorporated ex-ante into the conservation planning process. If protected areas are coupled with nonreserve policy instruments such as market subsidies, our model shows that the trade-offs between biodiversity and human well-being can be further and more directly reduced.},

Using several classic examples from fisheries management, I demonstrate that selecting the model or models that produce the most accurate and precise forecast (measured by statistical scores) can sometimes lead to worse outcomes (measured by real-world objectives). This can create a forecast trap, in which the outcomes such as fish biomass or economic yield decline while the manager becomes increasingly convinced that these actions are consistent with the best models and data available. The forecast trap is not unique to this example, but a fundamental consequence of non-uniqueness of models. Existing practices promoting a broader set of models are the best way to avoid the trap. {\copyright} 2022 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

In such situations, scientists may adopt what I term a `division of cognitive labor' among models, using different models for the purposes of explanation and prediction, respectively, even for the exact same phenomenon being investigated. Adopting this strategy raises a number of issues, however, which have received inadequate philosophical attention. More specifically, while one implication may be that it is inappropriate to judge explanatory models by the same standards of quantitative accuracy as predictive models, there still needs to be some way of either confirming or rejecting these model explanations. Here I argue that robustness analyses have a central role to play in testing highly idealized explanatory models. I illustrate these points with two examples of explanatory models from the field of geomorphology.},

Conveniently, Bayesian phylogenetic methods use currently available stochastic models of sequence evolution. However, as with other model-based approaches, the results of Bayesian inference are conditional on the assumed model of evolution: inadequate models (models that poorly fit the data) may result in erroneous inferences.

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to develop an epistemology of scientific models in scientific research practices, and to show that disciplinary perspectives have crucial role in such an epistemology. A transcendental (Kantian) approach is taken, aimed at explanations of the kinds of questions relevant to the intended epistemology, such as ``How is it possible that models provide knowledge about aspects of reality?'' The approach is also pragmatic in the sense that the questions and explanations must be adequate and relevant to concrete scientific practice. First it is explained why the idea of models as representations in terms of similarity or isomorphism between a model and its target is too limited as a basis for this epistemology. An important finding is that the target-phenomenon is usually not something that can be observed in a straightforward manner, but requires both characterization in terms of measurable variables and subsumption under (scientific) concepts. The loss of this basis leads to a number of issues, such as: how can models be interpreted as representations if models also include conceptually meaningful linguistic content; how can researchers identify non-observable real-world target-phenomena that are then represented in the model; how do models enable inferential reasoning in performing epistemic tasks by researchers; and, how to justify scientific models. My proposal is to deal with these issues by analyzing how models are constructed, rather than by looking at ready-made models. Based on this analysis, I claim that the identification of phenomena and the construction of scientific models is guided and also confined by the disciplinary perspective within which researchers in a scientific discipline have learned to work. I propose a Kuhnian framework by which the disciplinary perspective can be systematically articulated. Finally, I argue that harmful forms of subjectivism, due to the loss of the belief that models objectively represent aspects of reality, can be overcome by making the disciplinary perspective(s) in a research project explicit, thereby enabling its critical assessment, for which the proposed Kuhnian framework provides a tool.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is driving recent advances behind many everyday technologies, including speech and image recognition, natural language processing and autonomous driving. It is also gaining popularity in biology, where it has been used for automated species identification, environmental monitoring, ecological modelling, behavioural studies, DNA sequencing and population genetics and phylogenetics, among other applications. Deep learning relies on artificial neural networks for predictive modelling and excels at recognizing complex patterns. In this review we synthesize 818 studies using deep learning in the context of ecology and evolution to give a discipline-wide perspective necessary to promote a rethinking of inference approaches in the field. We provide an introduction to machine learning and contrast it with mechanistic inference, followed by a gentle primer on deep learning. We review the applications of deep learning in ecology and evolution and discuss its limitations and efforts to overcome them. We also provide a practical primer for biologists interested in including deep learning in their toolkit and identify its possible future applications. We find that deep learning is being rapidly adopted in ecology and evolution, with 589 studies (64\%) published since the beginning of 2019. Most use convolutional neural networks (496 studies) and supervised learning for image identification but also for tasks using molecular data, sounds, environmental data or video as input. More sophisticated uses of deep learning in biology are also beginning to appear. Operating within the machine learning paradigm, deep learning can be viewed as an alternative to mechanistic modelling. It has desirable properties of good performance and scaling with increasing complexity, while posing unique challenges such as sensitivity to bias in input data. We expect that rapid adoption of deep learning in ecology and evolution will continue, especially in automation of biodiversity monitoring and discovery and inference from genetic data. Increased use of unsupervised learning for discovery and visualization of clusters and gaps, simplification of multi-step analysis pipelines, and integration of machine learning into graduate and postgraduate training are all likely in the near future.},

GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and other materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses, and protocols. Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub in ecology and evolution is not widespread. To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub to improve their research workflows, we review 12 practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty, including storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, writing a manuscript, and using automated and continuous integration to streamline analyses. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration.

  abstract = {This paper reports findings from a crowdsourced replication. Eighty-five independent teams attempted a computational replication of results reported in an original study of policy preferences and immigration by fitting the same statistical models to the same data. The replication involved an experimental condition. Random assignment put participating teams into either the transparent group that received the original study and code, or the opaque group receiving only a methods section, rough results description and no code. The transparent group mostly verified the numerical results of the original study with the same sign and p-value threshold (95.7\%), while the opaque group had less success (89.3\%). Exact numerical reproductions to the second decimal place were far less common (76.9\% and 48.1\%), and the number of teams who verified at least 95\% of all effects in all models they ran was 79.5\% and 65.2\% respectively. Therefore, the reliability we quantify depends on how reliability is defined, but most definitions suggest it would take a minimum of three independent replications to achieve reliability. Qualitative investigation of the teams' workflows reveals many causes of error including mistakes and procedural variations. Although minor error across researchers is not surprising, we show this occurs where it is least expected in the case of computational reproduction. Even when we curate the results to boost ecological validity, the error remains large enough to undermine reliability between researchers to some extent. The presence of inter-researcher variability may explain some of the current ``reliability crisis'' in the social sciences because it may be undetected in all forms of research involving data analysis. The obvious implication of our study is more transparency. Broader implications are that researcher variability adds an additional meta-source of error that may not derive from conscious measurement or modeling decisions, and that replications cannot alone resolve this type of uncertainty.},

Here we used multi-model inference (MMI), a form of model averaging, based on information theory (Akaike's Information Criterion) to evaluate the relative strength of evidence for density-dependent and density-independent population dynamical models in long-term abundance time series of 1198 species. We also compared the MMI results to more classic methods for detecting density dependence: Neyman-Pearson hypothesis-testing and best-model selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion or cross-validation. Using MMI on our large database, we show that density dependence is a pervasive feature of population dynamics (median MMI support for density dependence = 74.7-92.2\%), and that this holds across widely different taxa. The weight of evidence for density dependence varied among species but increased consistently, with the number of generations monitored. Best-model selection methods yielded similar results to MMI (a density-dependent model was favored in 66.2-93.9\% of species time series), while the hypothesis-testing methods detected density dependence less frequently (32.6-49.8\%). There were no obvious differences in the prevalence of density dependence across major taxonomic groups under any of the statistical methods used. These results underscore the value of using multiple modes of analysis to quantify the relative empirical support for a set of working hypotheses that encompass a range of realistic population dynamical behaviors.},

We used four different measures of project outcomes--ecological, economic, attitudinal, and behavioral--to test hypotheses derived from the assumptions that underlie contemporary conservation solutions.

We reviewed the conservation and development literature and used a specific protocol to extract and code the information in a sample of papers. Although our results are by no means conclusive and suffer from the paucity of high-quality data and independent monitoring (80\% of the original sample of 124 projects provided inadequate information for use in this study), they show that permitted use of natural resources, market access, and greater community involvement in the conservation project are all important factors for a successful outcome. Without better monitoring schemes in place, it is still impossible to provide a systematic evaluation of how different strategies are best suited to different conservation challenges.},

The EBV framework was developed to distill the complexity of biodiversity into a manageable list of priorities and to bring a more coordinated approach to observing biodiversity on a global scale. However, efforts to address the scientific challenges associated with this task have been hindered by diverse interpretations of the definition of an EBV. Here, the authors define an EBV as a critical biological variable that characterizes an aspect of biodiver- sity, functioning as the interface between raw data and indicators. This relationship is clarified through a multi- faceted stock market analogy, drawing from relevant examples of biodiversity indicators that use EBVs, such as the Living Planet Index and the UK Spring Index. Through this analogy, the authors seek to make the EBV concept accessible to a wider audience, especially to non-specialists and those in the policy sector, and to more clearly de- fine the roles of EBVs and their relationship with biodiversity indicators. From this we expect to support advance- ment towards globally coordinated measurements of biodiversity.},

These challenges are exacerbated by the scientific community's capacity to consistently distinguish between reliable and unreliable evidence, including the recognition of questionable research practices (QRPs, or ``questionable practices''), which may threaten the credibility of research, including harming trust in well-designed and reliable scientific research. In this paper, we propose a ``toolkit'' for open and pluralistic conservation science, highlighting common questionable practices and sources of bias and indicating where remedies for these problems may be found. The toolkit provides an accessible resource for anyone conducting, reviewing, or using conservation research, to identify sources of false claims or misleading evidence that arise unintentionally, or through misunderstandings or carelessness in the application of scientific methods and analyses. We aim to influence editorial and review practices and hopefully to remedy problems before they are published or deployed in policy or conservation practice.},

The hope is that, by using computational social science methods to analyse large-scale observational data from social media, human behaviour can be studied with greater statistical power and ecological validity. However, current standards of null hypothesis significance testing and correlational statistics seem ill-suited to markedly noisy, high-dimensional social media datasets. We explore this point by probing the moral contagion phenomenon, whereby the use of moral-emotional language increases the probability of message spread. Through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, we find that the moral contagion model performs no better than an implausible XYZ contagion model. This highlights the risks of using purely correlational evidence from large observational datasets and sounds a cautionary note for psychology's merge with big data.},

But such examples of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP) serve to obscure the less flagrant, more subtle cases of possible misconduct: what some have called ``questionable research practices'' (QRPs). Where FFP is seen as inherently negative, QRPs fall into an ethical ``gray zone'' between permissible and impermissible. We draw on semistructured interviews with business school scholars to explore the occurrence of QRPs. Prevalent QRPs include playing with numbers, playing with models, and playing with hypotheses. Scholars explain the existence of QRPs in three ways: the inadequate training of researchers, the pressures and incentives to publish in certain outlets, and the demands and expectations of journal editors and reviewers. We argue that a paradox is at work here: To live up to the positivist image of ``pure science'' that appears in academic journals, researchers may find themselves---ironically---transgressing this very ideal. Ultimately, this challenges the individualistic account of academic misconduct by drawing attention to the role played by institutional actors, such as academic journals, in encouraging forms of QRPs.},

  abstract = {Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a `systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.},

Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},

The efficiency of a search (the number of references retrieved by a database as a percentage of the total number retrieved across all databases) ranged from 5\% to 92\%. Different subscriptions to WoS and WoSCC returned different numbers of references. Additionally, we asked 114 conservation biologists which databases they used, their awareness of differing search options within databases and their awareness of different subscription options. The four most widely used databases were GS (88\%), WoS (59\%), WoSCC (58\%) and Scopus (27\%). Most respondents ({$\geq$}65\%) were unsure about specific features in databases, although 66\% knew of the service GS Citations, and 76\% agreed that GS retrieved grey literature effectively. Respondents' publication history did not influence their responses. Researchers seeking comprehensive literature reviews should consult multiple databases, with online searches using GS important for locating books, book chapters and grey literature. Comparative evaluations of publication outputs of researchers or departments are susceptible to variations in content between databases and different subscriptions of the same database, so researchers should justify the databases used and, if applicable, the subscriptions. Students value convenience over thoroughness in literature searches, so relevant education is needed.},

  abstract = {It is thought that the science of ecology has experienced conceptual shifts in recent decades, chiefly from viewing nature as static and balanced to a conception of constantly changing, unpredictable, complex ecosystems. Here, we ask if these changes are reflected in actual ecological research over the last 30 years. We surveyed 750 articles from the entire pool of ecological literature and 750 articles from eight leading journals. Each article was characterized according to its type, ecological domain, and applicability, and major topics. We found that, in contrast to its common image, ecology is still mostly a study of single species (70\% of the studies); while ecosystem and community studies together comprise only a quarter of ecological research. Ecological science is somewhat conservative in its topics of research (about a third of all topics changed significantly through time), as well as in its basic methodologies and approaches. However, the growing proportion of problem-solving studies (from 9\% in the 1980s to 20\% in the 2000 s) may represent a major transition in ecological science in the long run.},

Accordingly, most scientific journals require authors to report experimental procedures in sufficient detail for independent researchers to replicate their work. To what extent do research reports in the functional neuroimaging literature live up to this standard? The present study evaluated methods reporting and methodological choices across 241 recent fMRI articles. Many studies did not report critical methodological details with regard to experimental design, data acquisition, and analysis. Further, many studies were underpowered to detect any but the largest statistical effects. Finally, data collection and analysis methods were highly flexible across studies, with nearly as many unique analysis pipelines as there were studies in the sample. Because the rate of false positive results is thought to increase with the flexibility of experimental designs, the field of functional neuroimaging may be particularly vulnerable to false positives. In sum, the present study documented significant gaps in methods reporting among fMRI studies. Improved methodological descriptions in research reports would yield significant benefits for the field.},

Communicating these complex models to non-scientists is challenging, but necessary, because decision-makers and other end users need to understand, accept, and use the models and their predictions. Despite the importance of communicating effectively with end users, there is little guidance available as to how this may be achieved. Here, we review the challenges typically encountered by modellers attempting to communicate complex models and their outputs to managers and other non-scientist end users. We discuss the implications of failing to communicate effec- tively in each case. We then suggest a general approach for communicating with non-scientist end users. We detail the specific elements to be communicated using the example of individual-based models, which are widely used in ecology. We demonstrate that despite their complexity, individual-based models have characteristics that can facilitate communication with non-scientists. The approach we propose is based on our experiences and methods used in other fields, but which until now have not been synthesised or made broadly available to ecologists. Our aim is to facilitate the process of communicating with end users of complex models and encourage more modellers to engage in it by providing a structured approach to the communication process. We argue that developing measures of the effectiveness of communication with end users will help increase the impact of complex models in ecology.},

  abstract = {Aim Invasion ecology includes many hypotheses. Empirical evidence suggests that most of these can explain the success of some invaders to some degree in some circumstances. If they all are correct, what does this tell us about invasion? We illustrate the major themes in invasion ecology, and provide an overarching framework that helps organize research and foster links among subfields of invasion ecology and ecology more generally. Location Global. Methods We review and synthesize 29 leading hypotheses in plant invasion ecology. Structured around propagule pressure (P), abiotic characteristics (A) and biotic characteristics (B), with the additional influence of humans (H) on P, A and B (hereon PAB), we show how these hypotheses fit into one paradigm. P is based on the size and frequency of introductions, A incorporates ecosystem invasibility based on physical conditions, and B includes the characteristics of invading species (invasiveness), the recipient community and their interactions. Having justified the PAB framework, we propose a way in which invasion research could progress. Results By highlighting the common ground among hypotheses, we show that invasion ecology is encumbered by theoretical redundancy that can be removed through integration. Using both holistic and incremental approaches, we show how the PAB framework can guide research and quantify the relative importance of different invasion mechanisms. Main conclusions If the prime aim is to identify the main cause of invasion success, we contend that a top-down approach that focuses on PAB maximizes research efficiency. This approach identifies the most influential factors first, and subsequently narrows the number of potential causal mechanisms. By viewing invasion as a multifaceted process that can be partitioned into major drivers and broken down into a series of sequential steps, invasion theory can be rigorously tested, understanding improved and effective weed management techniques identified.},

Using examples from biological invasions, we identify two types of context dependence resulting from four sources: mechanistic context dependence arises from interaction effects; and apparent context dependence can arise from the presence of confounding factors, problems of statistical inference, and methodological differences among studies.

  abstract = {1. In managing various threats to biodiversity, it is important to prioritize multiple management actions, and the levels of effort to apply. However, a spatial conservation prioritization framework that integrates these key aspects, and can be generalized, is still missing. Moreover, assessing the robustness of prioritization frameworks to uncertainty in species responses to management is critical to avoid misallocation of limited resources. Yet, the impact of information uncertainty on prioritization of management effort remains unknown. 2. We present an approach for prioritizing alternative levels of conservation management effort to multiple actions, based on the ecological responses of species to management. We estimated species responses through a structured email-based expert elicitation process, where we also captured the uncertainty in individual experts' assessments. We identified priority locations and associated level of management of effort of four actions to abate threats to freshwater-dependent fauna, using a northern Australia case study, and quantified sensitivity of the proposed solution to uncertainty in the answers of each individual expert. 3. Achievement of conservation targets for freshwater-dependent fauna in the Daly River catchment would require 9.4 Million AU\$ per year, for a total of approximately 189 Million AU\$ investment over 20 years. We suggest that this could be best achieved through a mix of aerial shooting of buffalos and pigs, riparian fencing and chemical spraying of weeds, applied at varying levels of management effort in key areas of the catchment. 4. Uncertainty in experts' estimation of species responses to threats causes 60\% of the species to achieve 80\% of their conservation targets, which was consistent across target levels. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Accepted Article 5. Synthesis and applications. Our prioritization approach facilitates the planning of conservation management at fine spatial scales and is applicable to terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms. Plan implementation may require policy instruments ranging from landowner stewardship agreements, market-based mechanisms and low-intensity land use management schemes; to regulation of commercial activities within portions of marine protected areas. However, assessing plan sensitivity to uncertainty in species response to management and finding ways of dealing with it in the prioritization rather than ignoring it, as often done, remains vital for effective achievement of conservation objectives.},

  abstract = {Efforts to tackle the current biodiversity crisis need to be as efficient and effective as possible given chronic underfunding. To inform decision-makers of the most effective conservation actions, it is important to identify biases and gaps in the conservation literature to prioritize future evidence generation. We used the Conservation Evidence database to assess the state of the global literature that tests conservation actions for amphibians and birds. For the studies in the database, we investigated their spatial and taxonomic extent and distribution across biomes, effectiveness metrics, and study designs. Studies were heavily concentrated in Western Europe and North America for birds and particularly for amphibians, and temperate forest and grassland biomes were highly represented relative to their percentage of land coverage. Studies that used the most reliable study designs-before-after control-impact and randomized controlled trials-were the most geographically restricted and scarce in the evidence base. There were negative spatial relationships between the numbers of studies and the numbers of threatened and data-deficient species worldwide. Taxonomic biases and gaps were apparent for amphibians and birds-some entire orders were absent from the evidence base-whereas others were poorly represented relative to the proportion of threatened species they contained. Metrics used to evaluate effectiveness of conservation actions were often inconsistent between studies, potentially making them less directly comparable and evidence synthesis more difficult. Testing conservation actions on threatened species outside Western Europe, North America, and Australasia should be prioritized. Standardizing metrics and improving the rigor of study designs used to test conservation actions would also improve the quality of the evidence base for synthesis and decision-making. El Desaf{\'i}o de la Evidencia Sesgada en la Conservaci{\'o}n Resumen Los esfuerzos para lidiar con la actual crisis de la biodiversidad necesitan ser tan eficientes y efectivos como sea posible dado el cr{\'o}nico subfinanciamiento. Para informar a los {\'o}rganos de decisi{\'o}n sobre las acciones de conservaci{\'o}n m{\'a}s efectivas, es importante identificar los sesgos y las brechas en la literatura de la conservaci{\'o}n para priorizar generaci{\'o}n de evidencias en el futuro. Usamos la base de datos Conservation Evidence para evaluar el estado de la literatura mundial que analiza las acciones para la conservaci{\'o}n de anfibios y aves. Para los estudios dentro de la base de datos, investigamos su extensi{\'o}n espacial y taxon{\'o}mica y su distribuci{\'o}n a lo largo de biomas, medidas de efectividad y dise{\~n}os de estudio. Los estudios se concentraron principalmente en Europa Occidental y en Am{\'e}rica del Norte en el caso de las aves y particularmente para los anfibios. Los biomas con mayor representaci{\'o}n en relaci{\'o}n con su porcentaje de cobertura de suelo fueron el bosque templado y los pastizales. Los estudios que utilizaron el dise{\~n}o m{\'a}s confiable - impacto del control antes- despu{\'e}s y ensayos controlados al azar - fueron los que presentaron mayor restricci{\'o}n geogr{\'a}fica y menor presencia dentro de la base de evidencias. Tambi{\'e}n encontramos relaciones espaciales negativas entre el n{\'u}mero de estudios y el n{\'u}mero de especies amenazadas o con pocos datos a nivel mundial. Los sesgos y las brechas taxon{\'o}micas fueron evidentes para los anfibios y las aves - hubo {\'o}rdenes enteros ausentes en la base de evidencias - mientras que otros taxones estuvieron representados pobremente en relaci{\'o}n con la proporci{\'o}n de especies amenazadas que albergan. Las medidas utilizadas para evaluar la efectividad de las acciones de conservaci{\'o}n con frecuencia fueron incompatibles entre los estudios, lo que las hace potencialmente menos comparables directamente y tambi{\'e}n dificulta la s{\'i}ntesis de las evidencias. Se debe priorizar el an{\'a}lisis de las acciones para la conservaci{\'o}n de las especies que se encuentran fuera de Europa Occidental, Am{\'e}rica del Norte y Australasia. La estandarizaci{\'o}n de las medidas y el mejoramiento del rigor de los dise{\~n}os de estudio que se usan para evaluar las acciones de conservaci{\'o}n tambi{\'e}n mejorar{\'i}a la calidad de la base de evidencias para la s{\'i}ntesis y la toma de decisiones. 鉴于生物多样性保护长期面临着资金不足问题, 应对当下生物多样性危机的努力必须尽可能高效和有用。为了让决策者了解最有效的保护行动, 分辨保护文献中的偏倚和空缺来优先进行未来收集保护证据的工作十分重要。我们用保护证据数据库评估了全球两栖动物和鸟类保护行动的研究文献的情况, 并分析了数据库中研究的生物群系在空间和分类学上的范围和分布、有效性指标和研究设计。鸟类的研究主要集中在西欧和北美, 两栖动物也尤其如此, 另外, 对温带森林和草原的生物群系的研究相对于它们在陆地上的覆盖率有很高的代表性。采用最可靠的前后对照影响分析和随机对照试验设计的研究最容易受到地域限制且证据基础最少。全世界范围内, 研究数量与受威胁和缺乏数据的物种数量在空间上存在负相关关系。两栖动物和鸟类明显存在分类学偏倚和研究空缺, 有些目完全没有证据基础, 还有一些目相对于它们所包含的濒危物种的比例来说没有得到足够代表。此外, 用于评估保护行动有效性的指标在研究之间常常不一致, 可能导致研究不能直接比较, 而且证据的综合更加困难。我们提出, 应优先对西欧、北美和澳大拉西亚以外的濒危物种的保护行动进行调查。指标标准化、提高用于检验保护行动有效性研究设计的严谨性, 也将提高用于综合分析和决策的证据基础的质量。翻译: 胡怡思; 审校: 聂永刚.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Building trust in science and evidence-based decision-making depends heavily on the credibility of studies and their findings. Researchers employ many different study designs that vary in their risk of bias to evaluate the true effect of interventions or impacts. Here, we empirically quantify, on a large scale, the prevalence of different study designs and the magnitude of bias in their estimates. Randomised designs and controlled observational designs with pre-intervention sampling were used by just 23\% of intervention studies in biodiversity conservation, and 36\% of intervention studies in social science. We demonstrate, through pairwise within-study comparisons across 49 environmental datasets, that these types of designs usually give less biased estimates than simpler observational designs. We propose a model-based approach to combine study estimates that may suffer from different levels of study design bias, discuss the implications for evidence synthesis, and how to facilitate the use of more credible study designs.},

Simultaneously, new technologies including Internet and mobile phone based tools, now enable information to be garnered directly from individuals at the point of care. Here, we consider how these crowdsourced data offer the opportunity to fill gaps in and augment current epidemiological models. Challenges and methods for overcoming limitations of the data are also reviewed. As more new information sources become mature, incorporating these novel data into epidemiological frameworks will enable us to learn more about infectious disease dynamics.},

Adherence to the preregistration plan may not always be feasible and even is not necessarily desirable, but without disclosure of deviations, readers who do not carefully consult the preregistration plan might get the incorrect impression that the study was exactly conducted and reported as planned. In this paper, we have investigated adherence and disclosure of deviations for all articles published with the Preregistered badge in Psychological Science between February 2015 and November 2017 and shared our findings with the corresponding authors for feedback. Two out of 27 preregistered studies contained no deviations from the preregistration plan. In one study, all deviations were disclosed. Nine studies disclosed none of the deviations. We mainly observed (un)disclosed deviations from the plan regarding the reported sample size, exclusion criteria and statistical analysis. This closer look at preregistrations of the first generation reveals possible hurdles for reporting preregistered studies and provides input for future reporting guidelines. We discuss the results and possible explanations, and provide recommendations for preregistered research.},

  abstract = {An analytical model of disturbance and plant population dynamics is developed to explore the optimal life history for a plant within a @'shifting mosaic@' meta-population. The population dynamics consist of short-lived recruitment events followed by longer intervals of thinning. Plants balance costs and benefits of delayed maturation time that result from cohort thinning, a correlation between maturation time and longevity, and the distribution of recruitment events in space and time. Two fundamentally different responses to disturbance are explored: (1) the plant is killed by the disturbance that allows for new recruitment (type A response), and (2) the plant may survive many such disturbances (type B response). Species maximize either the probability of being reproductively mature at the time of the next recruitment opportunity (type A) or the total number of recruitment opportunities to occur during the period of reproductive maturity (type B). Predictions of the theory are compared with the actual life histories of trees that occur in different disturbance regimes. The costs and benefits associated with delayed maturation from an energy standpoint must be weighed against the probability that a recruitment opportunity (disturbance) will occur at a particular age. Trees subject to low thinning rates should reach reproductive maturity t"1 at t"1 @? 0.4 x (expected disturbance interval in years). At high thinning rates, this optimum is t"1 @? 0.4/(mortality rate per year). Disturbance probabilities that increase with time since the last disturbance select for maturation times that are greater than these values. Species that are not killed by disturbances have optimal maturation times that are independent of disturbance frequency. However, when such species are susceptible as juveniles, optimal maturation time does depend on disturbance frequency. This optimum maturation time is still greater than it is for the case of a mortality response (type A) to disturbance, but less than the case of no susceptibility period (type B). Application of the theory to real-world disturbance regimes results in predictions that closely match the life histories of species that actually occur there. The optimal maturation time for a gap species in temperate North American forests is 30-60 yr, a value that agrees with observed maturation time. A second test involved fire regimes where two species having very different responses to fire and life histories co-occur, Pinus resinosa and P. banksiana. The maturation times of these species both match the predicted optima for a species that survives fire (P. resinosa) vs. one that is killed by fire (P. banksiana) subjected to identical fire regimes. Different modes of dispersal are predicted to have important effects on reproductive potential, but little effect on the optimal maturation time. Application of the models to these actual cases is consistent with that prediction. The @'intermediate@' disturbance is predicted to be that which implies the optimum life history that coincides with the life histories of the greatest number of species.}

Recent studies suggest, however, that sharing code and data does not suffice for computational reproducibility ---defined as the ability of researchers to reproduce ``par- ticular analysis outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software'' (Fidler and Wilcox, 2018). To date, creating long-term computationally reproducible code has been technically challenging and time-consuming. This tutorial introduces Code Ocean, a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform that attempts to solve these problems. It does this by adapting software engineering tools, such as Docker, for easier use by scientists and scientific audiences. In this article, we first outline arguments for the importance of computational reproducibility, as well as some reasons why this is a nontrivial problem for researchers. We then provide a step-by-step guide to getting started with containers in research using Code Ocean. (Disclaimer: the authors all worked for Code Ocean at the time of this article's writing.)},

We used a stochastic simulation model of fire processes to estimate the mean fire-return interval that would maximize stand structural diversity. We investigated trade-offs between structural diversity and temporal population stability associated with changes in the fire interval and used a deterministic version of the model to explore the effects of scheduling fires at fixed intervals. In stochastic simulations, maximum structural diversity occurred at intermediate levels of disturbance (40-year mean fire interval). When fires were scheduled at fixed intervals, a longer, 100-year return interval maximized diversity. Mean fire-return interval was a mitigating factor in the diversity-stability relationship, which changed from positive to negative as the fire interval was reduced progressively from 250 to 5 years. As an alternative to scheduling fires at specified mean intervals, we developed a goal-programming model (a form of linear programming model) and used it to identify an optimal fire schedule for achieving habitat and visual-quality objectives. In comparison with the 40-year stochastic mean fire interval, which maximized structural diversity, the optimal schedule produced comparable levels of both diversity and fire frequency. Our results show how simulation and goal-programming models can be used to evaluate prescribed fire-scheduling alternatives and to explore the comparative advantages of natural and optimal fire-management approaches.},

The calibration phase of these models is critical, but despite recent attempts at providing tools for performing this step, adequate detail is still missing. Here, we present the kuenm R package, a new set of tools for performing detailed development of ecological niche models using the platform Maxent in a reproducible way. Results:  This package takes advantage of the versatility of R and Maxent to enable detailed model calibration and selection, final model creation and evaluation, and extrapolation risk analysis. Best parameters for modeling are selected considering (1) statistical significance, (2) predictive power, and (3) model complexity. For final models, we enable multiple parameter sets and model transfers, making processing simpler. Users can also evaluate extrapolation risk in model transfers via mobility-oriented parity (MOP) metric. Discussion:  Use of this package allows robust processes of model calibration, facilitating creation of final models based on model significance, performance, and simplicity. Model transfers to multiple scenarios, also facilitated in this package, significantly reduce time invested in performing these tasks. Finally, efficient assessments of strict-extrapolation risks in model transfers via the MOP and MESS metrics help to prevent overinterpretation in model outcomes.},

Here, we define and differentiate between process-based and mechanistic features of models, and we identify and discuss important advantages of working with models possessing such features. We describe some of the risks associated with process-based and mechanistic model-centered research programs, and we propose ways to mitigate these risks. Giving process-based and mechanistic models a more central role in research programs can reinvigorate macroecology by strengthening the link between theory and data.},

  abstract = {Decision making in guidance of reintroduction efforts is made challenging by the substantial scientific uncertainty typically involved. However, a less recognized challenge is that the management objectives are often numerous and complex. Decision makers managing reintroduction efforts are often concerned with more than just how to maximize the probability of reintroduction success from a population perspective. Decision makers are also weighing other concerns such as budget limitations, public support and/or opposition, impacts on the ecosystem, and the need to consider not just a single reintroduction effort, but conservation of the entire species. Multiple objective decision analysis is a powerful tool for formal analysis of such complex decisions. We demonstrate the use of multiple objective decision analysis in the case of the Florida non-migratory whooping crane reintroduction effort. In this case, the State of Florida was considering whether to resume releases of captive-reared crane chicks into the non-migratory whooping crane population in that state. Management objectives under consideration included maximizing the probability of successful population establishment, minimizing costs, maximizing public relations benefits, maximizing the number of birds available for alternative reintroduction efforts, and maximizing learning about the demographic patterns of reintroduced whooping cranes. The State of Florida engaged in a collaborative process with their management partners, first, to evaluate and characterize important uncertainties about system behavior, and next, to formally evaluate the tradeoffs between objectives using the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART). The recommendation resulting from this process, to continue releases of cranes at a moderate intensity, was adopted by the State of Florida in late 2008. Although continued releases did not receive support from the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team, this approach does provide a template for the formal, transparent consideration of multiple, potentially competing, objectives in reintroduction decision making. {\copyright} 2013 The Wildlife Society.

  abstract = {Policy development and management decisions should be based upon the best available evidence. In recent years, approaches to evidence synthesis, originating in the medical realm (such as systematic reviews), have been applied to conservation to promote evidence-based conservation and environmental management. Systematic reviews involve a critical appraisal of evidence, but studies that lack the necessary rigour (e.g. experimental, technical and analytical aspects) to justify their conclusions are typically excluded from systematic reviews or down-weighted in terms of their influence. One of the strengths of conservation physiology is the reliance on experimental approaches that help to more clearly establish cause-and-effect relationships. Indeed, experimental biology and ecology have much to offer in terms of building the evidence base that is needed to inform policy and management options related to pressing issues such as enacting endangered species recovery plans or evaluating the effectiveness of conservation interventions. Here, we identify a number of pitfalls that can prevent experimental findings from being relevant to conservation or would lead to their exclusion or down-weighting during critical appraisal in a systematic review. We conclude that conservation physiology is well positioned to support evidence-based conservation, provided that experimental designs are robust and that conservation physiologists understand the nuances associated with informing decision-making processes so that they can be more relevant.},

Open science, which aims to make the research process more open and reproducible, has been proposed as one approach to increase the credibility and impact of scientific research. Although relatively little attention has been paid to open science in relation to single-case design, we propose that open-science practices can be applied to enhance the credibility and impact of single-case design research. In this article, we discuss how open-science practices align with other recent developments in single-case design research, describe four prominent open-science practices (i.e., preregistration, registered reports, data and materials sharing, and open access), and discuss potential benefits and limitations of each practice for single-case design.},

  abstract = {Background: Systematic literature searching is recognised as a critical component of the systematic review process. It involves a systematic search for studies and aims for a transparent report of study identification, leaving readers clear about what was done to identify studies, and how the findings of the review are situated in the relevant evidence. Information specialists and review teams appear to work from a shared and tacit model of the literature search process. How this tacit model has developed and evolved is unclear, and it has not been explicitly examined before. The purpose of this review is to determine if a shared model of the literature searching process can be detected across systematic review guidance documents and, if so, how this process is reported in the guidance and supported by published studies. Method: A literature review. Two types of literature were reviewed: guidance and published studies. Nine guidance documents were identified, including: The Cochrane and Campbell Handbooks. Published studies were identified through `pearl growing', citation chasing, a search of PubMed using the systematic review methods filter, and the authors' topic knowledge. The relevant sections within each guidance document were then read and re-read, with the aim of determining key methodological stages. Methodological stages were identified and defined. This data was reviewed to identify agreements and areas of unique guidance between guidance documents. Consensus across multiple guidance documents was used to inform selection of `key stages' in the process of literature searching. Results: Eight key stages were determined relating specifically to literature searching in systematic reviews. They were: who should literature search, aims and purpose of literature searching, preparation, the search strategy, searching databases, supplementary searching, managing references and reporting the search process. Conclusions: Eight key stages to the process of literature searching in systematic reviews were identified. These key stages are consistently reported in the nine guidance documents, suggesting consensus on the key stages of literature searching, and therefore the process of literature searching as a whole, in systematic reviews. Further research to determine the suitability of using the same process of literature searching for all types of systematic review is indicated.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:title{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/jats:title{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Exposure to food cues activates the brain's reward system and undermines efforts to regulate impulses to eat. During explicit regulation, lateral prefrontal cortex activates and modulates the activity in reward regions and decreases food cravings. However, the extent to which between-person differences in the recruitment of regions associated with reward processing, subjective valuation and regulation during food cue exposure---absent instructions to regulate---predict body composition and daily eating behaviors is unclear. In this preregistered study, we pooled data from five functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) samples (N\,=\,262) to examine whether regions associated with reward, valuation and regulation, as well as whole-brain pattern expression indexing these processes, were recruited during food cue exposure and associated with body composition and real-world eating behavior. Regression models for a single a priori analytic path indicated that univariate and multivariate measures of reward and valuation were associated with individual differences in body mass index and the enactment of daily food cravings. Specification curve analyses further revealed reliable associations between univariate and multivariate neural indicators of reactivity, regulation and valuation and all outcomes. These findings highlight the utility of these methods to elucidate brain--behavior associations and suggest that multiple processes are implicated in proximal and distal markers of eating behavior.},

  abstract = {In recent years, open science practices have become increasingly popular in psychology and related sciences. These practices aim to increase rigour and transparency in science as a potential response to the challenges posed by the replication crisis. Many of these reforms -- including the highly influential preregistration -- have been designed for experimental work that tests simple hypotheses with standard statistical analyses, such as assessing whether an experimental manipulation has an effect on a variable of interest. However, psychology is a diverse field of research, and the somewhat narrow focus of the prevalent discussions surrounding and templates for preregistration has led to debates on how appropriate these reforms are for areas of research with more diverse hypotheses and more complex methods of analysis, such as cognitive modelling research within mathematical psychology. Our article attempts to bridge the gap between open science and mathematical psychology, focusing on the type of cognitive modelling that Cr{\"u}well, Stefan, \& Evans (2019) labelled model application, where researchers apply a cognitive model as a measurement tool to test hypotheses about parameters of the cognitive model. Specifically, we (1) discuss several potential researcher degrees of freedom within model application, (2) provide the first preregistration template for model application, and (3) provide an example of a preregistered model application using our preregistration template. More broadly, we hope that our discussions and proposals constructively advance the debate surrounding preregistration in cognitive modelling, and provide a guide for how preregistration templates may be developed in other diverse or complex research contexts.},

We review the state of code availability in ecology using a random sample of 346 nonmolecular articles published between 2015 and 2019 under mandatory or encouraged code-sharing policies. Our results call for urgent action to increase code availability: only 27\% of eligible articles were accompanied by code. In contrast, data were available for 79\% of eligible articles, highlighting that code availability is an important limiting factor for computational reproducibility in ecology. Although the percentage of ecological journals with mandatory or encouraged code-sharing policies has increased considerably, from 15\% in 2015 to 75\% in 2020, our results show that code-sharing policies are not adhered to by most authors. We hope these results will encourage journals, institutions, funding agencies, and researchers to address this alarming situation.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation requires knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers to enable learning and support evidence-based decision-making. Efforts to improve knowledge exchange have been hindered by a paucity of empirically-grounded guidance to help scientists and practitioners design and implement research programs that actively facilitate knowledge exchange. To address this, we evaluated the Ningaloo Research Program (NRP), which was designed to generate new scientific knowledge to support evidence-based decisions about the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park in north-western Australia. Specifically, we evaluated (1) outcomes of the NRP, including the extent to which new knowledge informed management decisions; (2) the barriers that prevented knowledge exchange among scientists and managers; (3) the key requirements for improving knowledge exchange processes in the future; and (4) the core capacities that are required to support knowledge exchange processes. While the NRP generated expansive and multidisciplinary science outputs directly relevant to the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park, decision-makers are largely unaware of this knowledge and little has been integrated into decision-making processes. A range of barriers prevented efficient and effective knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers including cultural differences among the groups, institutional barriers within decision-making agencies, scientific outputs that were not translated for decision-makers and poor alignment between research design and actual knowledge needs. We identify a set of principles to be implemented routinely as part of any applied research program, including; (i) stakeholder mapping prior to the commencement of research programs to identify all stakeholders, (ii) research questions to be co-developed with stakeholders, (iii) implementation of participatory research approaches, (iv) use of a knowledge broker, and (v) tailored knowledge management systems. Finally, we articulate the individual, institutional and financial capacities that must be developed to underpin successful knowledge exchange strategies.},

AI provides methods to represent and infer knowledge, efficiently manipulate texts and learn from vast amount of data. These characteristics are applicable in many activities that human find laborious or repetitive, as is the case of the analysis of scientific literature. Manually preparing and writing a systematic literature review (SLR) takes considerable time and effort, since it requires planning a strategy, conducting the literature search and analysis, and reporting the findings. Depending on the area under study, the number of papers retrieved can be of hundreds or thousands, meaning that filtering those relevant ones and extracting the key information becomes a costly and error-prone process. However, some of the involved tasks are repetitive and, therefore, subject to automation by means of AI. In this paper, we present a survey of AI techniques proposed in the last 15 years to help researchers conduct systematic analyses of scientific literature. We describe the tasks currently supported, the types of algorithms applied, and available tools proposed in 34 primary studies. This survey also provides a historical perspective of the evolution of the field and the role that humans can play in an increasingly automated SLR process.},

We developed a structured elicitation protocol, where opinions are directly incorporated into Bayesian Network (BBN) models. The 4-stage protocol includes approaches to minimise biases during pre-elicitation, workshop facilitation and output analysis; and results in a fully functional BBN model. We illustrate our protocol using examples from environmental flow management in Australia, presenting models of vegetation responses to changes in riverine flow regimes. The reliance on expert opinion and the contested nature of many environmental management decisions mean that our structured elicitation protocol is potentially of great value for developing robust environmental recommendations. This method also lends itself to effective adaptive management, because the expert-populated ecological response models can be readily updated with field data.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods are slowly creeping into all fields of science and are becoming ever more popular in applied research. Although it is very attractive to use Bayesian statistics, our personal experience has led us to believe that naively applying Bayesian methods can be dangerous for at least 3 main reasons: the potential influence of priors, misinterpretation of Bayesian features and results, and improper reporting of Bayesian results. To deal with these 3 points of potential danger, we have developed a succinct checklist: the WAMBS-checklist (When to worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). The purpose of the questionnaire is to describe 10 main points that should be thoroughly checked when applying Bayesian analysis. We provide an account of "when to worry" for each of these issues related to: (a) issues to check before estimating the model, (b) issues to check after estimating the model but before interpreting results, (c) understanding the influence of priors, and (d) actions to take after interpreting results. To accompany these key points of concern, we will present diagnostic tools that can be used in conjunction with the development and assessment of a Bayesian model. We also include examples of how to interpret results when "problems" in estimation arise, as well as syntax and instructions for implementation. Our aim is to stress the importance of openness and transparency of all aspects of Bayesian estimation, and it is our hope that the WAMBS questionnaire can aid in this process.

  abstract = {Arbitrary modeling choices are inevitable in scientific studies. Yet, few empirical studies in conservation science report the effects these arbitrary choices have on estimated results. I explored the effects of subjective modeling choices in the context of counterfactual impact evaluations. Over 5000 candidate models based on reasonable changes in the choice of statistical matching algorithms (e.g., genetic and nearest distance mahalanobis matching), the parametrization of these algorithms (e.g., number of matches), and the inclusion of specific covariates (e.g., distance to nearest city, slope, or rainfall) were valid for studying the effect of Virunga National Park in Democratic Republic of the Congo on changes in tree cover loss and carbon storage over time. I randomly picked 2000 of the 5000 candidate models to determine how much and which subjective modeling choices affected the results the most. All valid models indicated that tree cover loss decreased and carbon storage increased in Virunga National Park from 2000 to 2019. Nonetheless, the order of magnitude of the estimates varied by a factor of 3 (from -4.78 to -13.12 percentage points decrease in tree cover loss and from 20 to 46 t Ce/ha for carbon storage). My results highlight that modeling choices, notably the choice of the matching algorithm, can have significant effects on point estimates and suggest that more structured robustness checks are a key step toward more credible findings in conservation science. Selecciones Subjetivas de Modelos y la Contundencia de las Evaluaciones de Impacto en las Ciencias de la Conservaci{\'o}n Resumen Las selecciones arbitrarias de modelos son inevitables en los estudios cient{\'i}ficos.

  abstract = {The literature on the reproducibility crisis presents several putative causes for the proliferation of irreproducible results, including HARKing, p-hacking and publication bias. Without a theory of reproducibility, however, it is difficult to determine whether these putative causes can explain most irreproducible results. Drawing from an historically informed conception of science that is open and collaborative, we identify the components of an idealized experiment and analyze these components as a precursor to develop such a theory. Openness, we suggest, has long been intuitively proposed as a solution to irreproducibility. However, this intuition has not been validated in a theoretical framework. Our concern is that the under-theorizing of these concepts can lead to flawed inferences about the (in)validity of experimental results or integrity of individual scientists. We use probabilistic arguments and examine how openness of experimental components relates to reproducibility of results. We show that there are some impediments to obtaining reproducible results that precede many of the causes often cited in literature on the reproducibility crisis. For example, even if erroneous practices such as HARKing, p-hacking, and publication bias were absent at the individual and system level, reproducibility may still not be guaranteed.},

However, some of these reform attempts suffer from the same mistakes and over-generalizations they purport to address. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for more rigor and nuance in methodological reform. By way of example, we present a formal analysis of three common claims in the metascientific literature: (a) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (b) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (c) that exploratory projects are characterized by poor statistical practice. We show that none of these three claims are correct in general and we explore when they do and do not hold.}

We tested how different study areas and predictors affect SDMs by using consensus projections of a fixed set of 224 stream macroinvertebrate species and five algorithms imple- mented in BIOMOD/R. Four modelling designs were applied: (1) a landscape as a continuous study area without any discrimination between terrestrial and aquatic realms, (2) a stream network masked a pos- teriori from the previous design, (3) a stream network as the study area during the model-building stage, and (4) same as (3) but with a hydrologically corrected set of predictors. The true skill statistic (TSS) and accuracy of the consensus projections were not influenced by the different designs (TSS ranged from 0.80 to 1.00, accuracy ranged from 0.70 to 0.96). The projections of design (4) yielded a strong reduction in false positive predictions compared to (1) (on average by 56\%), (2) (11\%) or (3) (8\%). Our results show how SDMs with equally high accuracy may differ widely in habitat suitability projections for benthic macroinvertebrates. As model performance and output are not necessarily congruent, habitat suitability projections of stream biota need to be carefully assessed.},

  abstract = {Aim: Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic interactions from co- occurrence information at a large spatial scale. However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. Approach: We present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid errone- ously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroeco- logical studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Findings: Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species' co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusions: Moving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the inter- pretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interac- tions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.},

  abstract = {Within the field of species distribution modelling an apparent dichotomy exists between process-based and correlative approaches, where the processes are explicit in the former and implicit in the latter. However, these intuitive distinctions can become blurred when comparing species distribution modelling approaches in more detail. In this review article, we contrast the extremes of the correlative--process spectrum of species distribution models with respect to core assumptions, model building and selection strategies, validation, uncertainties, common errors and the questions they are most suited to answer. The extremes of such approaches differ clearly in many aspects, such as model building approaches, parameter estimation strategies and transferability. However, they also share strengths and weaknesses. We show that claims of one approach being intrinsically superior to the other are misguided and that they ignore the process--correlation continuum as well as the domains of questions that each approach is addressing. Nonetheless, the application of process-based approaches to species distribution modelling lags far behind more correlative (process-implicit) methods and more research is required to explore their potential benefits. Critical issues for the employment of species distribution modelling approaches are given, together with a guideline for appropriate usage. We close with challenges for future development of process-explicit species distribution models and how they may complement current approaches to study species distributions.},

Non-Bayesian, but still probabilistic, theories provide plausible competitors both to descriptive and normative Bayesian accounts. We argue for this general idea via recent work on explanationist models of updating, which are fundamentally probabilistic but assign a substantial, non-Bayesian role to explanatory considerations.},

We here report the results from prediction markets set up to quantify the reproducibility of 44 studies published in prominent psychology journals and replicated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The prediction markets predict the outcomes of the replications well and outperform a survey of market participants' individual forecasts. This shows that prediction markets are a promising tool for assessing the reproducibility of published scientific results. The prediction markets also allow us to estimate probabilities for the hypotheses being true at different testing stages, which provides valuable information regarding the temporal dynamics of scientific discovery. We find that the hypotheses being tested in psychology typically have low prior probabilities of being true (median, 9\%) and that a "statistically significant" finding needs to be confirmed in a well-powered replication to have a high probability of being true. We argue that prediction markets could be used to obtain speedy information about reproducibility at low cost and could potentially even be used to determine which studies to replicate to optimally allocate limited resources into replications.},

  abstract = {A stage-based model was developed for the population dynamics of Banksia goodii, a rare long-lived shrub in Western Australia. While few seeds are produced, death of adults due to senescence or fire has yet to be observed. A sensitivity analysis showed that population growth is close to zero as long as post-fire mortality and recruitment are within their usual low bounds. To remain viable, the size of a population remnant should exceed about 80 individuals. If fires occur at random intervals, an average of one fire in 10--15 years is optimal. Regular fires should have inter-fire periods of 15--20 years. Loss of adult plants due to human activities, such as land clearing, will increase mortality beyond its natural bounds and cannot be compensated for, due to the low fecundity of this species. Hand sowing after a fire may raise establishment by orders of magnitude and achieve a permanent population increase within the first year. Conservation authorities should target the sensitive factors through active management at the recruitment stage and by ensuring that no further loss of mature plants takes place through land clearance. {\copyright}},

Challenges include, among others, the adequate representation of feedback loops between the socio-economic and the ecological subsystems, uncertainties and human behaviour. To analyse how well models are able to address these challenges in the fields of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management the present paper systematically reviews recent mechanistic models of the field and analyses them with respect to a number of binary criteria. The reviewed models generally contain quite a few of the above-mentioned system features but still fall short when it comes to the adequate representation of the socio-economic dimension. Sorting the models by the labels given to them by their authors, such as ``ecological- economic'' or ``system-dynamic'', allows assessing model variation within and among labels and indicates that there is a fruitful level of diversity in the models.},

  abstract = {1. The use of expert knowledge (EK) as an alternative to empirical data is increasing in the ecological disciplines in response to the growing need for rapid decisions that are embraced by local communities and implemented under strong resource constraints. Despite this increasing use, the validity of EK as a data source is still questioned by some who label it as biased or unreliable. Transparency in the methods applied in the use of EK allows confirmation of methodological rigour and study repeatability; key steps towards promoting the acceptance of EK as a valid data source. However, the practiced levels of methodological transparency in EK use are currently unknown in the ecological disciplines. 2. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic review of transparency in methods applied in the use of EK, focusing on research in forest ecology and man- agement as a case study. Covering the period from 1990 to 2016, we identified 296 publications that employed EK, which were assessed for their reporting on 15 methodological criteria of EK use. 3. Our results indicate that transparency in the use of EK is generally very low, with only three out of 15 methodological criteria addressed in more than 50\% of pub- lications. Nevertheless, overall reporting on EK methods, and the reporting of four individual methodological criteria, were positively affected by publication year, suggesting that researchers increasingly recognize the importance of trans- parency in the use of EK methods. 4. Synthesis and applications. Given the growing use of expert knowledge (EK) in the ecological disciplines, there is an urgent need to further its acceptance as a valid data source. To achieve this goal, researchers need to be more diligent in following best practices and reporting on EK methods. We therefore present a proposed set of guidelines for the reporting of EK methods. However, journal editors and re- viewers also can play an important role in reaching this goal by requiring authors to transparently report on EK methods, just as they would expect for the use of empirical data.},

  abstract = {The replicability of findings in experimental psychology can be improved by distinguishing sharply between hypothesis-generating research and hypothesis-testing research. This distinction can be achieved by preregistration, a method that has recently attracted widespread attention. Although preregistration is fair in the sense that it inoculates researchers against hindsight bias and confirmation bias, preregistration does not allow researchers to analyze the data flexibly without the analysis being demoted to exploratory. To alleviate this concern we discuss how researchers may conduct blinded analyses (MacCoun and Perlmutter in Nature 526:187--189, 2015). As with preregistration, blinded analyses break the feedback loop between the analysis plan and analysis outcome, thereby preventing cherry-picking and significance seeking.  However, blinded analyses retain the flexibility to account for unexpected peculiarities in the data.  We discuss different methods of blinding, offer recommendations for blinding of popular experimental designs, and introduce the design for an online blinding protocol.},

But few studies capture early relationship development: the interstitial period in which people experience rising and falling romantic interest for partners who could---but often do not---become sexual or dating partners. In this study, 208 single participants reported on 1,065 potential romantic partners across 7,179 data points over 7 months. In stage 1, we used random forests (a type of machine learning) to estimate how well different classes of variables (e.g., individual differences vs. target-specific constructs) predicted participants' romantic interest in these potential partners. We also tested (and found only modest support for) the perceiver {\texttimes} target moderation account of compatibility: the meta-theoretical perspective that some types of perceivers experience greater romantic interest for some types of targets. In stage 2, we used multilevel modeling to depict predictors retained by the random-forests models; robust (positive) main effects emerged for many variables, including sociosexuality, sex drive, perceptions of the partner's positive attributes (e.g., attractive and exciting), attachment features (e.g., proximity seeking), and perceived interest. Finally, we found no support for ideal partner preference-matching effects on romantic interest. The discussion highlights the need for new models to explain the origin of romantic compatibility.},

  abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

Our results indicate that instructors use, teach, and view data management, analysis, and visualization as important data science skills. Coding, modeling, and reproducibility were less valued by the instructors, although this differed according to institution type and career stage. The greatest barriers were instructor and student background and space in the curriculum. The instructors were most interested in training on how to teach coding and data analysis.

  abstract = {We conducted the               Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology               to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68\% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were               extremely               or               very helpful               for 41\% of experiments, they were               minimally helpful               for 9\% of experiments, and               not at all helpful               (or did not respond to us) for 32\% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67\% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41\% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication -- it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.},

To this end, we put forth a taxonomy that defines an environmental modelling study as being either 1) repeatable, 2) runnable, 3) reproducible, or 4) replicable. We introduce these terms with illustrative examples from hydrology using a hydrologic modelling framework along with cyberin- frastructure aimed at fostering reproducibility. Using this taxonomy as a guide, we argue that containerization is an important but lacking component needed to achieve the goal of computational reproducibility in hydrology and environmental modelling. Examples from hydrology are provided to demonstrate how new tools, including a user-friendly tool for containerization of computational analyses called Sciunit, can lower the barrier to repro- ducibility and replicability in the environmental modelling community.},

Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions {$\leq$}1 m2 and extents {$\leq$}10,000 ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated ({$>$}1 month interval) and {$\leq$}1 year in dura- tion. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better under- stand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentive- ness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards.},

  abstract = {Managing agricultural landscapes to support biodiversity conservation requires profound structural changes worldwide. Often, discussions are centered on management at the field level. However, a wide and growing body of evidence calls for zooming out and targeting agricultural policies, research, and interventions at the landscape level to halt and reverse the decline in biodiversity, increase biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, and improve the resilience and adaptability of these ecosystems. We conducted the most comprehensive assessment to date on landscape complexity effects on nondomesticated terrestrial biodiversity through a meta-analysis of 1,134 effect sizes from 157 peer-reviewed articles. Increasing landscape complexity through changes in composition, configuration, or heterogeneity significatively and positively affects biodiversity. More complex landscapes host more biodiversity (richness, abundance, and evenness) with potential benefits to sustainable agricultural production and conservation, and effects are likely underestimated. The few articles that assessed the combined contribution of linear (e.g., hedgerows) and areal (e.g., woodlots) elements resulted in a near-doubling of the effect sizes (i.e., biodiversity level) compared to the dominant number of studies measuring these elements separately. Similarly, positive effects on biodiversity are stronger in articles monitoring biodiversity for at least 2 y compared to the dominant 1-y monitoring efforts. Besides, positive and stronger effects exist when monitoring occurs in nonoverlapping landscapes, highlighting the need for long-term and robustly designed monitoring efforts. Living in harmony with nature will require shifting paradigms toward valuing and promoting multifunctional agriculture at the farm and landscape levels with a research agenda that untangles complex agricultural landscapes' contributions to people and nature under current and future conditions.},

  abstract = {The world is experiencing significant, largely anthropogenically induced, environmental change. This  will impact on the biological world and we need to be able to forecast its effects. In order to produce such forecasts, ecology needs to become more predictive--to develop the ability to understand how ecological systems will behave in future, changed, conditions. Further development of process-based models is required to allow such predictions to be made. Critical to the development of such models will be achieving a balance between the brute-force approach that naively attempts to include everything, and over simplification that throws out important heterogeneities at various levels. Central to this will be the recognition that individuals are the elementary particles of all ecological systems. As such it will be necessary to understand the effect of evolution on ecological systems, particularly when exposed to environmental change. However, insights from evolutionary biology will help the development of models even when data may be sparse. Process-based models are more common, and are used for forecasting, in other disciplines, e.g. climatology and molecular systems biology. Tools and techniques developed in these endeavours can be appropriated into ecological modelling, but it will also be necessary to develop the science of ecoinformatics along with approaches specific to ecological problems. The impetus for this effort should come from the demand coming from society to understand the effects of environmental change on the world and what might be performed to mitigate or adapt to them.},

  abstract = {Preregistration is the practice of publicly publishing plans on central components of the research process before access to, or collection, of data. Within the context of the replication crisis, open science practices like preregistration have been pivotal in facilitating greater transparency in research. However, such practices have been applied nearly exclusively to basic academic research, with rare consideration of the relevance to applied and consultancy-based research. This is particularly problematic as such research is typically reported with very low levels of transparency and accountability despite being disseminated as influential gray literature to inform practice. Evidence-based practice is best served by an appre\- ciation of multiple sources of quality evidence, thus the current review considers the potential of preregistration to improve both the accessibility and credibility of applied research toward more rigorous evidence-based practice. The current three-part review outlines, first, the opportunities of preregis\- tration for applied research, and second, three barriers -- prac\- tical challenges, stakeholder roles, and the suitability of preregistration. Last, this review makes four recommendations to overcome these barriers and maximize the opportunities of preregistration for academics, industry, and the structures they are held within -- changes to preregistration templates, new types of templates, education and training, and recognition and structural changes.},

Our experiments, based on a statistical (meta-)analysis, show that, in aggregate, there is a small correlation ({$r$} = 0.23) between understandability and verifiability. The results support the claim that easy-to-verify code is often easier to understand than code that requires more effort to verify. Our work has implications for the users and designers of verification tools and for future attempts to automatically measure code comprehensibility: verification tools may have ancillary benefits to understandability, and measuring understandability may require reasoning about semantic, not just syntactic, code properties.},

Here, we address this issue for ecological niche modelling or species distribution modelling, a rapidly developing toolset in ecology used across many aspects of biodiversity science. Our quantitative review of the recent literature reveals a general lack of sufficient information to fully reproduce the work. Over two-thirds of the examined studies neglected to report the version or access date of the underlying data, and only half reported model parameters. To address this problem, we propose adopting a checklist to guide studies in reporting at least the minimum information necessary for ecological niche modelling reproducibility, offering a straightforward way to balance efficiency and accuracy. We encourage the ecological niche modelling community, as well as journal reviewers and editors, to utilize and further develop this framework to facilitate and improve the reproducibility of future work. The proposed checklist framework is generalizable to other areas of ecology, especially those utilizing biodiversity data, environmental data and statistical modelling, and could also be adopted by a broader array of disciplines.},

Bottlenecks to informing models with observations have reduced our capacity to fully exploit the growing volume and variety of available data. Here, we take a critical look at the information infrastructure that connects ecosystem modeling and measurement efforts, and propose a roadmap to community cyberinfrastructure development that can reduce the divisions between empirical research and modeling and accelerate the pace of discovery. A new era of data-model integration requires investment in accessible, scalable, and transparent tools that integrate the expertise of the whole community, including both modelers and empiricists. This roadmap focuses on five key opportunities for community tools: the underlying foundations of community cyberinfrastructure; data ingest; calibration of models to data; model-data benchmarking; and data assimilation and ecological forecasting.

The tendency of psychological science to avoid publishing null results produces a situation that limits the replicability assumption of science, as replication cannot be meaningful without the potential acknowledgment of failed replications. We argue that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science's capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous ``undead'' theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.},

Analyses of such large-scale, natural experiments are common in the health and econometrics literature, where techniques have been developed to derive insight from large, noisy observational data sets. Here, we apply a technique from this literature, synthetic control, to assess landscape change with remote sensing data. The basic data requirements for synthetic control include (1) a discrete set of treated and untreated units, (2) a known date of treatment intervention, and (3) time series response data that include both pre- and post-treatment outcomes for all units. Synthetic control generates a response metric for treated units relative to a no-action alternative based on prior relationships between treated and unexposed groups. Using simulations and a case study involving a large-scale brush-clearing management event, we show how synthetic control can intuitively infer treatment effect sizes from satellite data, even in the presence of confounding noise from climate anomalies, long-term vegetation dynamics, or sensor errors. We find that accuracy depends on the number and quality of potential control units, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate control populations. Although we consider the synthetic control approach in the context of natural experiments with remote sensing data, we expect the methodology to have wider utility in ecology, particularly for systems with large, complex, and poorly replicated experimental units.},

In a survey of German psychologists, we decomposed QRP prevalence into its two multiplicative components, proportion of scientists who ever committed a behavior and, if so, how frequently they repeated this behavior across all their research. The resulting prevalence estimates are lower by order of magnitudes. We conclude that inflated prevalence estimates, due to problematic interpretation of survey data, can create a descriptive norm (QRP is normal) that can counteract the injunctive norm to minimize QRPs and unwantedly damage the image of behavioral sciences, which are essential to dealing with many societal problems.},

  abstract = {In light of the "replication crisis," some advocate for stricter standards and greater transparency in research methods. These efforts push toward a data analysis approach called "confirmatory data analysis" (CDA; see Wagenmakers et al., 2012). However, some (e.g., Baumeister, 2016; Goldin-Meadow, 2016) suggest that emphasizing CDA may restrict creativity and discovery. These scholars argued (sometimes inadvertently) for greater freedom to pursue "exploratory data analysis" (EDA; see Tukey, 1977). Ironically and unfortunately, many who push against stricter CDA standards do not realize EDA exists, or misunderstand the philosophy and proper tools for exploration. In this article, the meaning, tools, philosophy, and ethics associated with EDA, CDA, and a relatively unknown but important approach called "rough CDA" are clarified. Important distinctions are developed between EDA/rough CDA/CDA and other (some problematic) analysis activities including p-hacking, HARKing, and data mining, which are situated in a (graphical) framework that clarifies relationships and ethical boundaries with each. In short, the proper data analytic approach depends on (a) intentions and (b) transparency. Most psychological research is not at a maturity level to justify CDA; researchers have historically used tools mismatched to their research agenda. In the conclusion, recommendations are presented about how these typologies can be integrated into graduate training programs and how a cumulative research program can help psychology move beyond the replication crisis.

  abstract = {Effective coding is fundamental to the study of biology. Computation underpins most research, and reproducible science can be promoted through clean coding practices. Clean coding is crafting code design, syntax and nomenclature in a manner that maximizes the potential to communicate its intent with other scientists. However, computational biologists are not software engineers, and many of our coding practices have developed ad hoc without formal training, often creating difficult-to-read code for others. Hard-to-understand code can thus be limiting our efficiency and ability to communicate as scientists with one another. The purpose of this paper is to provide a primer on some of the practices associated with crafting clean code by synthesizing a transformative text in software engineering along with recent articles on coding practices in computational biology. We review past recommendations to provide a series of best practices that transform coding into a human-accessible form of communication. Three common themes shared in this synthesis are the following: (a) code has value and you are responsible for its organization to enable clear communication, (b) use a formatting style to guide writing code that is easily understandable and consistent and (c) apply abstraction to emphasize important elements and declutter. While many of the provided practices and recommendations were developed with computational biologists in mind, we believe there is wider applicability to any biologist undertaking work in data management or statistical analyses. Clean code is thus a crucial step forward in resolving some of the crisis in reproducibility for science.},

  abstract = {A central tenet of reproducible research is that scientific results are published along with the underlying data and software code necessary to reproduce and verify the findings. A host of tools and software have been released that facilitate such work-flows and scientific journals have increasingly demanded that code and primary data be made available with publications. There has been little practical advice on implementing reproducible research work-flows for large 'omics' or systems biology data sets used by teams of analysts working in collaboration. In such instances it is important to ensure all analysts use the same version of a data set for their analyses. Yet, instantiating relational databases and standard operating procedures can be unwieldy, with high ''startup'' costs and poor adherence to procedures when they deviate substantially from an analyst's usual work-flow. Ideally a reproducible research work-flow should fit naturally into an individual's existing work-flow, with minimal disruption. Here, we provide an overview of how we have leveraged popular open source tools, including Bioconductor, Rmarkdown, git version control, R, and specifically R's package system combined with a new tool DataPackageR, to implement a lightweight reproducible research work-flow for preprocessing large data sets, suitable for sharing among small-to-medium sized teams of computational scientists. Our primary contribution is the DataPackageR tool, which decouples time-consuming data processing from data analysis while leaving a traceable record of how raw data is processed into analysis-ready data sets. The software ensures packaged data objects are properly documented and performs checksum verification of these along with basic package version management, and importantly, leaves a record of data processing code in the form of package vignettes. Our group has implemented this work-flow to manage, analyze and report on pre-clinical immunological trial data from multi-center, multi-assay studies for the past three years.},

If there is a high probability that native vegetation will be disturbed, then management efforts should focus on future populations by attempting to reduce the size of the invader seed bank. This complicates control, as seed bank size is difficult to measure and reducing it requires intensive actions, which are likely to also negatively affect the seed bank of native species. If, however, the probability of disturbance of native sites can be reduced, practitioners can shift control from future populations to the current population, which is more straightforward to implement and monitor.},

Doubts arise for a host of reasons, including a lack of transparency, ignorance, negligence, or misrepresentation of the evidence. We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study's inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.},

To identify common challenges and ultimately strengthen replication research, we conducted a systematic review of the measures used in the 100 original and replication studies from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Results indicate that it was common for scales used in the original studies to have little or no validity evidence. Our systematic review demonstrates and corroborates evidence that issues of construct validity are sorely neglected in original and replicated research. We identify four measurement challenges replicators are likely to face: a lack of essential measurement information, a lack of validity evidence, measurement differences, and translation. Next, we offer solutions for addressing these challenges that will improve measurement practices in original and replication research. Finally, we close with a discussion of the need to develop measurement methodologies for the next generation of replication research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).},

These bushfires were one of several recent global conflagrations across landscapes that are homelands of Indigenous peoples, homelands that were invaded and colonised by European nations over recent centuries. The subsequent suppression and cessation of Indigenous landscape management has had profound social and environmental impacts. The Black Summer bushfires have brought Indigenous cultural burning practices to the forefront as a potential management tool for mitigating climate-driven catastrophic bushfires in Australia. Here, we highlight new research that clearly demonstrates that Indigenous fire management in Southeast Australia produced radically different landscapes and fire regimes than what is presently considered ``natural''. We highlight some barriers to the return of Indigenous fire management to Southeast Australian landscapes. We argue that to adequately address the potential for Indigenous fire management to inform policy and practice in managing Southeast Australian forest landscapes, scientific approaches must be decolonized and shift from post-hoc engagement with Indigenous people and perspectives to one of collaboration between Indigenous communities and scientists.},

  abstract = {Streamflow and water temperature (hydroclimate) influence the life histories of aquatic biota. The relationship between streamflow and temperature varies with climate, hydrogeomorphic setting, and season. Life histories of native fishes reflect, in part, their adaptation to regional hydroclimate (flow and water temperature), local habitats, and natural disturbance regimes, all of which may be affected by water management. Alterations to natural hydroclimates, such as those caused by river regulation or climate change, can modify the suitability and variety of in-stream habitat for fishes throughout the year. Here, we present the ichthyograph, a new empirically-based graphical tool to help visualize relationships between hydroclimate and fish phenology. Generally, this graphical tool can be used to display a variety of phenotypic traits. We used long-term data sets of daily fish passage to examine linkages between hydroclimate and the expression of life-history phenology by native fishes. The ichthyograph may be used to characterize the environmental phenology for fishes across multiple spatio-temporal domains. We illustrate the ichthyograph in two applications to visualize: 1) river use for the community of fishes at a specific location; and 2) stream conditions at multiple locations within the river network for one species at different life-history stages. The novel, yet simple, ichthyograph offers a flexible framework to enable transformations in thinking regarding relationships between hydroclimate and aquatic species across space and time. The potential broad application of this innovative tool promotes synergism between assessments of physical characteristics and the biological needs of aquatic species.},

We consider how these issues affect developmental cognitive neuroscience, with the goal of progressing our field to support strong and defensible inferences from our neurobiological data. This manuscript focuses on the importance of distinguishing between confirmatory versus exploratory data analysis approaches in developmental cognitive neuroscience. Regarding confirmatory research, we discuss problems with analytic flexibility, appropriately instantiating hypotheses, and controlling the error rate given how we threshold data and correct for multiple comparisons. To counterbalance these concerns with confirmatory analyses, we present two complementary strategies. First, we discuss the advantages of working within an exploratory analysis framework, including estimating and reporting effect sizes, using parcellations, and conducting specification curve analyses. Second, we summarize defensible approaches for null hypothesis significance testing in confirmatory analyses, focusing on transparent and reproducible practices in our field. Specific recommendations are given, and templates, scripts, or other resources are hyperlinked, whenever possible.},

GLOMO is based on Schwarz and Bless' (1992, 2007) inclusion-exclusion model, which suggests that when information is included into a category, assimilation occurs, whereas when information is excluded from a category, contrast occurs. According to GLOMO, inclusion versus exclusion should be influenced by whether people process information globally or locally. In 5 experiments, using both disambiguation and social comparison, the authors induced local versus global processing through perceptual tasks and time perspective and showed that global processing produced assimilation, whereas local processing produced contrast. The experiments showed that processing styles elicited in one task can carry over to other tasks and influence social judgments. Furthermore, they found that hemisphere activation and accessibility of judgment-consistent knowledge partially mediated these effects. Implications for current and classic models of social judgment are discussed.}

Due to their abundance, road crossings and dams reduce the amount of habitat available to fish that migrate from the sea or lakes into rivers to breed. The benefits to fish of removing any particular barrier depends on its location within the river network, its passability to fish, and the relative position of other barriers within the network. Balancing the trade-offs between ecological and societal values makes choosing among potential removal projects difficult. To facilitate prioritization of barrier removals, we developed an online decision support tool (DST) with three functions: (1) view existing barriers at various spatial scales; (2) modify information about barriers, including removal costs; and (3) run optimization models to identify portfolios of removals that provide the greatest amount of habitat access for a given budget. A survey of available DSTs addressing barrier removal prioritiza- tion indicates that barrier visualization is becoming widespread but few tools allow dynamic calculation of connectivity metrics, scenario analysis, or optimization. Having these additional functions, our DST enables organizations to develop barrier removal priorities based on cost-effectiveness in restoring aquatic connectivity.},

We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64\% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42\% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51\% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

The humped-back model (HBM) suggests that plant diversity peaks at intermediate productivity; at low productivity few species can tolerate the environmental stresses, and at high productivity a few highly competitive species dominate. Over time the HBM has become increasingly controversial, and recent studies claim to have refuted it. Here, by using data from coordinated surveys conducted throughout grasslands worldwide and comprising a wide range of site productivities, we provide evidence in support of the HBM pattern at both global and regional extents. The relationships described here provide a foundation for further research into the local, landscape, and historical factors that maintain biodiversity.},

The majority of ecologists in our sample considered replication studies to be important (97\%), not prevalent enough (91\%), worth funding even given limited resources (61\%), and suitable for publication in all journals (62\%). However, there is a disconnect between this enthusiasm and the prevalence of direct replication studies in the literature which is much lower (0.023\%: Kelly 2019) than our participants' median estimate of 10\%. This may be explained by the obstacles our participants identified including the difficulty of conducting replication studies and of funding and publishing them.

  abstract = {To robustly predict the effects of disturbance and ecosystem changes on species, it is necessary to produce structurally realistic models with high predictive power and flexibility. To ensure that these models reflect the natural conditions necessary for reliable prediction, models must be informed and tested using relevant empirical observations. Pattern-oriented modelling (POM) offers a systematic framework for employing empirical patterns throughout the modelling process and has been coupled with complex systems modelling, such as in agent-based models (ABMs). However, while the production of ABMs has been rising rapidly, the explicit use of POM has not increased. Challenges with identifying patterns and an absence of specific guidelines on how to implement empirical observations may limit the accessibility of POM and lead to the production of models which lack a systematic consideration of reality. This review serves to provide guidance on how to identify and apply patterns following a POM approach in ABMs (POM-ABMs), specifically addressing: where in the ecological hierarchy can we find patterns; what kinds of patterns are useful; how should simulations and observations be compared; and when in the modelling cycle are patterns used? The guidance and examples provided herein are intended to encourage the application of POM and inspire efficient identification and implementation of patterns for both new and experienced modellers alike. Additionally, by generalising patterns found especially useful for POM-ABM development, these guidelines provide practical help for the identification of data gaps and guide the collection of observations useful for the development and verification of predictive models. Improving the accessibility and explicitness of POM could facilitate the production of robust and structurally realistic models in the ecological community, contributing to the advancement of predictive ecology at large.},

As applied modeling is increasingly used to address conservation problems, guidelines are required to clarify the scope of modeling applications and to facilitate the impact and acceptance of models by practitioners. We identify three key roles for quantitative models in conservation management: (a) to assess the extent of a conservation problem; (b) to provide insights into the dynamics of complex social and ecological systems; and, (c) to evaluate the efficacy of proposed conservation interventions. We describe 10 recommendations to facilitate the acceptance of quantitative models in conservation management, providing a basis for good practice to guide their development and evaluation in conservation applications. We structure these recommendations within four established phases of model construction, enabling their integration within existing workflows: (a) design (two recommendations); (b) specification (two); (c) evaluation (one); and (d) inference (five). Quantitative modeling can support effective conservation management provided that both managers and modelers understand and agree on the place for models in conservation. Our concise review and recommendations will assist conservation managers and modelers to collaborate in the development of quantitative models that are fit-for-purpose, and to trust and use these models appropriately while understanding key drivers of uncertainty.},

Many species are not perfectly detectable and, even when present, may remain undetected during EIA surveys, increasing the risk of site-level loss or extinction of species. Numerous methods now exist for estimating detectability of plants and animals. Despite this, regulations concerning survey protocol and effort during EIAs fail to adequately address issues of detectability. Probability of detection is intrinsically linked to survey effort; thus, minimum survey effort requirements are a useful way to address the risks of false absences. We utilized 2 methods for determining appropriate survey effort requirements during EIA surveys. One method determined the survey effort required to achieve a probability of detection of 0.95 when the species is present. The second method estimated the survey effort required to either detect the species or reduce the probability of presence to 0.05. We applied these methods to Pimelea spinscens subsp. spinescens, a critically endangered grassland plant species in Melbourne, Australia. We detected P. spinescens in only half of the surveys undertaken at sites where it was known to exist. Estimates of the survey effort required to detect the species or demonstrate its absence with any confidence were much higher than the effort traditionally invested in EIA surveys for this species. We argue that minimum survey requirements be established for all species listed under threatened species legislation and hope that our findings will provide an impetus for collecting, compiling, and synthesizing quantitative detectability estimates for a broad range of plant and animal species.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility and replicability are fundamentally important aspects of the scientific method. From time to time the discussion about whether scientific findings are replicable enough flares up. In fact, some recent publications claim we are witnessing a replication crisis. This is a particularly important problem in laboratory organisms that are relatively new, i.e., for which only limited amount of information is available, and for which only a limited number of methods have been developed. The zebrafish is a relative newcomer in behavioral neuroscience. This review considers four distinct reasons as possibly underlying reproducibility issues in behavioral neuroscience studies using the zebrafish. One, publication bias for positive results. Two, statistical issues that surround the question of how to address type 1 and type 2 errors, and how to make statistical inference. Three, inappropriate control of factors that are known to potentially influence results. And four, methodological issues stemming from insufficient understanding of factors that may influence experimental results. The review will mainly focus on experimental issues and solutions, i.e. the latter two reasons listed above. It is not intended to be comprehensive, and its examples are drawn mainly from the author's own studies and experience with zebrafish. Nevertheless, most issues discussed are not unique to his laboratory, to the zebrafish, or even to behavioral neuroscience.},

We identified factors possibly contributing to QRPs in the reporting of messages and conclusions through a literature review, 14 semi-structured interviews with HSR institutional leaders, and 13 focus-groups amongst researchers. A survey corresponding with these factors was developed and shared with 172 authors of 116 scientific HSR publications produced by Dutch research institutes in 2016. We assessed the included publications for the occurrence of QRPs. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify factors within individual, institutional, and environmental domains. Next, we conducted bivariate analyses using simple Poisson regression to explore factors' association with the number of QRPs in the assessed HSR publications.

In all four multivariate models, a higher score of ``pressure to create societal impact'' (Exp B\,=\,1.28, 95\% CI [1.11, 1.47]), was associated with higher number of QRPs. Higher scores on ``specific training'' (Exp B\,=\,0.85, 95\% CI [0.77--0.94]) and ``co-author conflict of interest'' (Exp B\,=\,0.85, 95\% CI [0.75--0.97]) factors were associated with a lower number of QRPs.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:  There are major problems with failure to replicate research findings. Contributing to this problem is a failure to report on factors related to external validity. Frequently, researchers have little knowledge whether findings apply more generally, especially to low-resource settings and underserved populations. The CONSORT flow diagram has improved reporting on variables related to internal validity, but it has very limited detail on issues related to external validity. A recent CONSORT update and other publications have called for more transparent reporting on external validity and context, and information regarding the sustainability of interventions. All of these elements influence the generalizability of findings from outcomes research. METHODS:  Drawing on theory, a prior meeting, and recent recommendations for reporting factors related to external validity, the authors propose an expansion of the basic CONSORT flow diagram for clinical trials to concisely summarize these data that recent CONSORT statements and other guidelines have recommended. RESULTS:  The authors propose the use of an expanded CONSORT figure and illustrate its utility with an example. The expanded CONSORT figure adds data about participation and representativeness at the levels of settings and staff, and about intervention sustainability after project support ends. The authors provide an expanded CONSORT figure reporting template, and demonstrate its use. CONCLUSIONS:  Improving transparent reporting on external validity by using the proposed expanded CONSORT figure would help to address both the scientific replication crisis and health equity concerns. This figure provides a method to efficiently address the representativeness, generalizability, and sustainability of outcomes research.},

  abstract = {Reintroduction of native species has become increasingly important in conservation worldwide for recov- ery of rare species and restoration purposes. However, few studies have reported the outcome of reintro- duction efforts in plant species. Using data from the literature combined with a questionnaire survey, this paper analyses 249 plant species reintroductions worldwide by assessing the methods used and the results obtained from these reintroduction experiments. The objectives were: (1) to examine how suc- cessful plant species reintroductions have been so far in establishing or significantly augmenting viable, self-sustaining populations in nature; (2) to determine the conditions under which we might expect plant species reintroductions to be most successful; (3) to make the results of this survey available for future plant reintroduction trials. Results indicate that survival, flowering and fruiting rates of reintroduced plants are generally quite low (on average 52\%, 19\% and 16\%, respectively). Furthermore, our results show a success rate decline in individual experiments with time. Survival rates reported in the literature are also much higher (78\% on average) than those mentioned by survey participants (33\% on average). We identified various parameters that positively influence plant reintroduction outcomes, e.g., working in protected sites, using seedlings, increasing the number of reintroduced individuals, mixing material from diverse populations, using transplants from stable source populations, site preparation or management effort and knowledge of the genetic variation of the target species. This study also revealed shortcomings of common experimental designs that greatly limit the interpretation of plant reintroduction studies: (1) insufficient monitoring following reintroduction (usually ceasing after 4 years); (2) inadequate docu- mentation, which is especially acute for reintroductions that are regarded as failures; (3) lack of under- standing of the underlying reasons for decline in existing plant populations; (4) overly optimistic evaluation of success based on short-term results; and (5) poorly defined success criteria for reintroduc- tion projects. We therefore conclude that the value of plant reintroductions as a conservation tool could be improved by: (1) an increased focus on species biology; (2) using a higher number of transplants (preferring seedlings rather than seeds); (3) taking better account of seed production and recruitment},

Although conservation research is affected by specific bias, conservation is playing a major role in providing empirical evidence of human impacts on biodiversity. Encouraging biodiversity comebacks are also published and a wide range of conservation tools, beyond the development of protected areas in wilderness areas, are promoted. We argue that finding new routes to conservation is neither necessary nor sufficient to halt biodiversity loss.},

  abstract = {To analyze species count data when detection is imperfect, ecologists need models to estimate relative abundance in the presence of unknown sources of heterogeneity. Two candidate models are generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and hierarchical N-mixture models. GLMMs are computationally robust but do not explicitly separate detection from abundance patterns. N-mixture models separately estimate detection and abundance via a latent state but are sensitive to violations in assumptions and subject to practical estimation issues. When one can assume that detection is not systematically confounded with ecological patterns of interest, these two models can be viewed as sharing a heuristic framework for relative abundance estimation. Model selection can then~determine which predicts observed counts best, for example by AIC. We compared four N-mixture model variants and two GLMM variants for predicting bird counts in local subsets of a citizen science dataset, eBird, based on model selection and goodness-of-fit measures. We found that both GLMMs and N-mixture models---especially N-mixtures with beta-binomial detection submodels---were supported in a moderate number of datasets, suggesting that both tools are useful and that relative fit is context-dependent. We provide faster software implementations of N-mixture likelihood calculations and a reparameterization to interpret unstable estimates for N-mixture models.},

  abstract = {The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) programme `Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence' (SCORE) aims to generate confidence scores for a large number of research claims from empirical studies in the social and behavioural sciences. The confidence scores will provide a quantitative assessment of how likely a claim will hold up in an independent replication. To create the scores, we follow earlier approaches and use prediction markets and surveys to forecast replication outcomes. Based on an initial set of forecasts for the overall replication rate in SCORE and its dependence on the academic discipline and the time of publication, we show that participants expect replication rates to increase over time. Moreover, they expect replication rates to differ between fields, with the highest replication rate in economics (average survey response 58\%), and the lowest in psychology and in education (average survey response of 42\% for both fields). These results reveal insights into the academic community's views of the replication crisis, including for research fields for which no large-scale replication studies have been undertaken yet.},

  abstract = {Recent metaresearch studying the prevalence, types, causes and solutions to Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) has almost exclusively focussed on frequentist hypothesis-testing. However, within Conservation Science, modellers routinely conduct non-hypothesis testing research; building models that generate anticipatory predictions to guide policy and decision makers in managing threatened ecosystems and species. We expand the scope of current QRP work by proposing a conceptual framework for defining and understanding the emergence of QRPs within model-centric research. We surveyed the literature to construct `roadmaps' identifying the type and location of plausible QRPs within the model development process. There are many opportunities for undisclosed researcher degrees of freedom in ecological modelling. While there are direct analogues between NHST and non-NHST research, there are domain and context-specific nuances that influence the emergence of QRPs in model-centric research.},

  abstract = {Although variation in effect sizes and predicted values among studies of similar phenomena is inevitable, such variation far exceeds what might be produced by sampling error alone. One possible explanation for variation among results is differences among researchers in the decisions they make regarding statistical analyses. A growing array of studies has explored this analytical variability in different (mostly social science) fields, and has found substantial variability among results, despite analysts having the same data and research question. We implemented an analogous study in ecology and evolutionary biology, fields in which there have been no empirical exploration of the variation in effect sizes or model predictions generated by the analytical decisions of different researchers. We used two unpublished datasets, one from evolutionary ecology (blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, to compare sibling number and nestling growth) and one from conservation ecology (Eucalyptus, to compare grass cover and tree seedling recruitment), and the project leaders recruited 174 analyst teams, comprising 246 analysts, to investigate the answers to prespecified research questions. Analyses conducted by these teams yielded 141 usable effects for the blue tit dataset, and 85 usable effects for the Eucalyptus dataset. We found substantial heterogeneity among results for both datasets, although the patterns of variation differed between them. For the blue tit analyses, the average effect was convincingly negative, with less growth for nestlings living with more siblings, but there was near continuous variation in effect size from large negative effects to effects near zero, and even effects crossing the traditional threshold of statistical significance in the opposite direction. In contrast, the average relationship between grass cover and Eucalyptus seedling number was only slightly negative and not convincingly different from zero, and most effects ranged from weakly negative to weakly positive, with about a third of effects crossing the traditional threshold of significance in one direction or the other. However, there were also several striking outliers in the Eucalyptus dataset, with effects far from zero. For both datasets, we found substantial variation in the variable selection and random effects structures among analyses, as well as in the ratings of the analytical methods by peer reviewers, but we found no strong relationship between any of these and deviation from the meta-analytic mean. In other words, analyses with results that were far from the mean were no more or less likely to have dissimilar variable sets, use random effects in their models, or receive poor peer reviews than those analyses that found results that were close to the mean. The existence of substantial variability among analysis outcomes raises important questions about how ecologists and evolutionary biologists should interpret published results, and how they should conduct analyses in the future.}

  abstract = {Recent discussions of model selection and multimodel inference highlight a general challenge for researchers: how to convey the explanatory content of a hypothesized model or set of competing models clearly. The advice from statisticians for scientists employing multimodel inference is to develop a well-thought-out set of candidate models for comparison, though precise instructions for how to do that are typically not given. A coherent body of knowledge, which falls under the general term causal analysis, now exists for examining the explanatory scientific content of candidate models. Much of the literature on causal analysis has been recently developed, and we suspect may not be familiar to many ecologists. This body of knowledge comprises a set of graphical tools and axiomatic principles to support scientists in their endeavors to create "well-formed hypotheses," as statisticians are asking them to do. Causal analysis is complementary to methods such as structural equation modeling, which provides the means for evaluation of proposed hypotheses against data. In this paper, we summarize and illustrate a set of principles that can guide scientists in their quest to develop explanatory hypotheses for evaluation. The principles presented in this paper have the capacity to close the communication gap between statisticians, who urge scientists to develop well-thought-out coherent models, and scientists, who would like some practical advice for exactly how to do that.

Although the benefits of feedback between theoretical and empirical research are widely acknowledged by ecologists, this link is still not as strong as it could be in ecological research. This is in part because theory, particularly when expressed mathematically, can feel inaccessible to empiricists who may have little formal training in advanced math. To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory. We hope that empowering empiricists to embrace theory in their work will help move the field closer to a full integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

We have developed an extension to the CONSORT 2010 Statement for social and psychological interventions (CONSORT-SPI 2018) to help behavioural and social scientists report these studies transparently. METHODS:  Following a systematic review of existing reporting guidelines, we conducted an online Delphi process to prioritise the list of potential items for the CONSORT-SPI 2018 checklist identified from the systematic review. Of 384 international participants, 321 (84\%) participated in both rating rounds. We then held a consensus meeting of 31 scientists, journal editors, and research funders (March 2014) to finalise the content of the CONSORT-SPI 2018 checklist and flow diagram. RESULTS:  CONSORT-SPI 2018 extends 9 items (14 including sub-items) from the CONSORT 2010 checklist, adds a new item (with 3 sub-items) related to stakeholder involvement in trials, and modifies the CONSORT 2010 flow diagram. This Explanation and Elaboration (E\&E) document is a user manual to enhance understanding of CONSORT-SPI 2018. It discusses the meaning and rationale for each checklist item and provides examples of complete and transparent reporting. CONCLUSIONS:  The CONSORT-SPI 2018 Extension, this E\&E document, and the CONSORT website ( www.consort-statement.org ) are helpful resources for improving the reporting of social and psychological intervention RCTs.},

The large variety of taxonomic databases and related tools are often not well described. It is often unclear which databases are actively maintained or what is the original source of taxonomic information. In addition, software to access these databases is developed following non-compatible standards, which creates additional challenges for users. As a result, taxonomic harmonization has become a major obstacle in ecological studies that seek to combine multiple datasets.                                                                          Here, we review and categorize a set of major taxonomic databases publicly available as well as a large collection of R packages to access them and to harmonize lists of taxon names. We categorized available taxonomic databases according to their taxonomic breadth (e.g. taxon specific vs. multi-taxa) and spatial scope (e.g. regional vs. global), highlighting strengths and caveats of each type of database. We divided R packages according to their function, (e.g. syntax standardization tools, access to online databases, etc.) and highlighted overlaps among them. We present our findings (e.g. network of linkages, data and tool characteristics) in a ready-to-use Shiny web application (available at:                     https://mgrenie.shinyapps.io/taxharmonizexplorer/                     ).                                                                        We also provide general guidelines and best practice principles for taxonomic name harmonization. As an illustrative example, we harmonized taxon names of one of the largest databases of community time series currently available. We showed how different workflows can be used for different goals, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and providing practical solutions to avoid common pitfalls.                                                     To our knowledge, our opinionated review represents the most exhaustive evaluation of links among and of taxonomic databases and related R tools. Finally, based on our new insights in the field, we make recommendations for users, database managers and package developers alike.},

However, the hitherto promulgated "philosophy" of conceptual mathematical modelling was not in a position to convince empiricists of the possibilities afforded by mathematical models on the one hand, and on the other to prevent theorists from becoming so engrossed in their theories as to neglect the testability of their hypotheses. The goal of this paper is to reveal the shortcomings of this "philosophy" of mathematical modelling and to outline a more promising strategy for creating models. It recommends choosing "patterns" actually existing in ecological systems, rather than questions of a general nature, as a point of departure for conceptual models. In this way, the advantages of conceptual models can be utilized without having to relinquish the testability of the hypotheses proposed with the aid of the models.},

However, most psychologists refrain from explicitly addressing causal research questions and avoid drawing causal inference on the basis of nonexperimental evidence. We argue that this taboo against causal inference in nonexperimental psychology impairs study design and data analysis, holds back cumulative research, leads to a disconnect between original findings and how they are interpreted in subsequent work, and limits the relevance of nonexperimental psychology for policymaking. At the same time, the taboo does not prevent researchers from interpreting findings as causal effects-the inference is simply made implicitly, and assumptions remain unarticulated. Thus, we recommend that nonexperimental psychologists begin to talk openly about causal assumptions and causal effects. Only then can researchers take advantage of recent methodological advances in causal reasoning and analysis and develop a solid understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that can inform future research, theory, and policymakers.},

We reflect on challenges and opportunities faced by a 'boundary organisation' that interfaces between science and policy, taking as example the European Commission's Directorate General Joint Research Centre, whose mission is stated as that to be the "in-house science service". We suggest that such an institution can be exemplary as to what could be changed to improve the quality of evidence feeding into the policy processes in the European Union. This paper suggests how an in-house culture of reflexivity and humility could trigger changes in the existing styles and methods of scientific governance; at the JRC, taken as example, this would mean opening up to the existing plurality of norms and styles of scientific inquiry, and adopting more participatory approaches of knowledge production, assessment and governance. We submit that the institutional changes advocated here are desirable and urgent in order to confront the ongoing erosion of trust in 'evidence based policy', anticipating controversies before they become evident in the institutional setting in which institutions operate.},

At the same time, its implementation has engendered criticism and controversy, in some cases general and others specific to particular disciplines. Here we take the opportunity provided by the recent fortieth anniversary of meta-analysis to reflect on the accomplishments, limitations, recent advances and directions for future developments in the field of research synthesis.},

Engineering biological systems is a complex undertaking requiring a broader set of epistemic tools and methods than what is usually applied in today's discovery based research. Inductive reasoning as commonly used in computer science has proven to be a very efficient approach to build knowledge about complex megadimensional datasets, including synthetic biology applications. The authors conclude that the multi-heuristic nature of modern biotechnology makes it an engineering field primed for inductive reasoning to complement the dominating deductive tradition.},

  abstract = {A participatory Bayesian approach was used to investigate how the views of stakeholders could be utilized to develop models to help understand the Central Baltic herring fishery. In task one, we applied the Bayesian belief network methodology to elicit the causal assumptions of six stakeholders on factors that influence natural mortality, growth, and egg survival of the herring stock in probabilistic terms. We also integrated the expressed views into a meta-model using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. In task two, we used influence diagrams to study qualitatively how the stakeholders frame the management problem of the herring fishery and elucidate what kind of causalities the different views involve. The paper combines these two tasks to assess the suitability of the methodological choices to participatory modeling in terms of both a modeling tool and participation mode. The paper also assesses the potential of the study to contribute to the development of participatory modeling practices. It is concluded that the subjective perspective to knowledge, that is fundamental in Bayesian theory, suits participatory modeling better than a positivist paradigm that seeks the objective truth. The methodology provides a flexible tool that can be adapted to different kinds of needs and challenges of participatory modeling. The ability of the approach to deal with small data sets makes it cost-effective in participatory contexts. However, the BMA methodology used in modeling the biological uncertainties is so complex that it needs further development before it can be introduced to wider use in participatory contexts.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}Systematic reviews aim to maximise transparency and comprehensiveness, whilst also minimising subjectivity and sources of bias. Because of these time-consuming and complex tasks, systematic reviews are perceived as being resource-intensive. To date, published estimates of systematic review resource requirements have been largely anecdotal, being imprecise and not based on evidence. However, it is valuable to provide reliable means of estimating the resource and time requirements of systematic reviews and maps. We analysed all CEE systematic reviews (n=66) and maps (n=20) published or registered between 2012 and 2017 to estimate the average time needed to complete a systematic review and map. We then surveyed 33 experienced systematic reviewers to collate information on time needed for each stage of the review process. Our results show that the average CEE systematic review takes 157 days (SD; 22), whilst the average CEE systematic map takes 209 days (SD; 53). While screening of titles and abstracts is widely accepted to be time-consuming, in practice meta-data extraction and critical appraisal can take as long (or even longer) to complete, especially when producing systematic maps. Finally, we present a tool that allows the user to predict the time requirements of a review or map given information known about the planned methods and evidence base likely to be identified. Our tool uses evidence-based defaults as a useful starting point for those wishing to predict the time requirements for a particular review. Our analyses shed light on the most time-consuming stages of the systematic review and map process, and highlight key bottlenecks from the perspective of time requirements, helping future reviewers to plan their time accordingly. Future predictions of effort required to complete systematic reviews and maps could be improved if CEE and CEE review authors provided more detailed reporting of the methods and results of their reviewing processes.},

It is suggested that requiring authors to complete a checklist at the time of manuscript submission would improve the quality and transparency of scientific reporting, and ultimately enhance reproducibility. Whether a checklist enhances quality and transparency in reporting preclinical animal studies, however, has not been empirically studied. Here we searched two highly cited life science journals, one that requires a checklist at submission (Nature) and one that does not (Cell), to identify in vivo animal studies. After screening 943 articles, a total of 80 articles were identified in 2013 (pre-checklist) and 2015 (post-checklist), and included for the detailed evaluation of reporting methodological and analytical information. We compared the quality of reporting preclinical animal studies between the two journals, accounting for differences between journals and changes over time in reporting. We find that reporting of randomization, blinding, and sample-size estimation significantly improved when comparing Nature to Cell from 2013 to 2015, likely due to implementation of a checklist. Specifically, improvement in reporting of the three methodological information was at least three times greater when a mandatory checklist was implemented than when it was not. Reporting the sex of animals and the number of independent experiments performed also improved from 2013 to 2015, likely from factors not related to a checklist. Our study demonstrates that completing a checklist at manuscript submission is associated with improved reporting of key methodological information in preclinical animal studies.},

  abstract = {Experts are often asked to represent their uncertainty as a subjective probability. Structured protocols offer a transparent and systematic way to elicit and combine probability judgements from multiple experts. As part of this process, experts are asked to individually estimate a probability (e.g., of a future event) which needs to be combined/aggregated into a final group prediction. The experts' judgements can be aggregated behaviourally (by striving for consensus), or mathematically (by using a mathematical rule to combine individual estimates). Mathematical rules (e.g., weighted linear combinations of judgments) provide an objective approach to aggregation. However, the choice of a rule is not straightforward, and the aggregated group probability judgement's quality depends on it. The quality of an aggregation can be defined in terms of accuracy, calibration and informativeness. These measures can be used to compare different aggregation approaches and help decide on which aggregation produces the "best" final prediction.In the ideal case, individual experts' performance (as probability assessors) is scored, these scores are translated into performance-based weights, and a performance-based weighted aggregation is used. When this is not possible though, several other aggregation methods, informed by measurable proxies for good performance, can be formulated and compared. We use several data sets to investigate the relative performance of multiple aggregation methods informed by previous experience and the available literature. Even though the accuracy, calibration, and informativeness of the majority of methods are very similar, two of the aggregation methods distinguish themselves as the best and worst.},

Approaches that call for the integration of perspective into objectivity at the epistemological level or that systematically incorporate different perspectives at the statistical level already exist and are brought together in the manuscript. Recent developments in research methodology, such as transparency, reproducibility of research processes, pre-registration of studies, or free access to raw data, analysis strategies, and syntax, promote the explication of perspectives because they make the entire research process visible. How the explication of perspectives can be done practically is outlined in the manuscript. As a result, future research programs can be organized in such a way that meta-analyses and meta-meta-analyses can be conducted not only backward but forward and prospectively as a regular and thus well-prepared part of objectification and validation processes.},

Meta-research has evaluated the merits of some individual initiatives; however, this may not capture broader trends reflecting the cumulative contribution of these efforts. In this study, we manually examined a random sample of 250 articles in order to estimate the prevalence of a range of transparency and reproducibility-related indicators in the social sciences literature published between 2014 and 2017. Few articles indicated availability of materials (16/151, 11\% [95\% confidence interval, 7\% to 16\%]), protocols (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]), raw data (11/156, 7\% [2\% to 13\%]) or analysis scripts (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]), and no studies were pre-registered (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]). Some articles explicitly disclosed funding sources (or lack of; 74/236, 31\% [25\% to 37\%]) and some declared no conflicts of interest (36/236, 15\% [11\% to 20\%]). Replication studies were rare (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]). Few studies were included in evidence synthesis via systematic review (17/151, 11\% [7\% to 16\%]) or meta-analysis (2/151, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]). Less than half the articles were publicly available (101/250, 40\% [34\% to 47\%]). Minimal adoption of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices could be undermining the credibility and efficiency of social science research. The present study establishes a baseline that can be revisited in the future to assess progress.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

This paper examined 258,050 test results across 30,710 articles from eight high impact journals to investigate the existence of a peculiar prevalence of p-values just below .05 (i.e., a bump) in the psychological literature, and a potential increase thereof over time. We indeed found evidence for a bump just below .05 in the distribution of exactly reported p-values in the journals Developmental Psychology, Journal of Applied Psychology, and Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, but the bump did not increase over the years and disappeared when using recalculated p-values. We found clear and direct evidence for the QRP "incorrect rounding of p-value" (John, Loewenstein \& Prelec, 2012) in all psychology journals. Finally, we also investigated monotonic excess of p-values, an effect of certain QRPs that has been neglected in previous research, and developed two measures to detect this by modeling the distributions of statistically significant p-values. Using simulations and applying the two measures to the retrieved test results, we argue that, although one of the measures suggests the use of QRPs in psychology, it is difficult to draw general conclusions concerning QRPs based on modeling of p-value distributions.},

  abstract = {Head et al. (2015) provided a large collection of p-values that, from their perspective, indicates widespread statistical significance seeking (i.e., p-hacking). This paper inspects this result for robustness. Theoretically, the p-value distribution should be a smooth, decreasing function, but the distribution of reported p-values shows systematically more reported p-values for .01, .02, .03, .04, and .05 than p-values reported to three decimal places, due to apparent tendencies to round p-values to two decimal places. Head et al. (2015) correctly argue that an aggregate p-value distribution could show a bump below .05 when left-skew p-hacking occurs frequently. Moreover, the elimination of p~=~.045 and p~=~.05, as done in the original paper, is debatable. Given that eliminating p~=~.045 is a result of the need for symmetric bins and systematically more p-values are reported to two decimal places than to three decimal places, I did not exclude p~=~.045 and p~=~.05. I conducted Fisher's method .04~{$<~$}p~{$<~$}.05 and reanalyzed the data by adjusting the bin selection to .03875~{$<~$}p~{$\leq~$}.04 versus .04875~{$<~$}p~{$\leq~$}.05. Results of the reanalysis indicate that no evidence for left-skew p-hacking remains when we look at the entire range between .04~{$<~$}p~{$<~$}.05 or when we inspect the second-decimal. Taking into account reporting tendencies when selecting the bins to compare is especially important because this dataset does not allow for the recalculation of the p-values. Moreover, inspecting the bins that include two-decimal reported p-values potentially increases sensitivity if strategic rounding down of p-values as a form of p-hacking is widespread. Given the far-reaching implications of supposed widespread p-hacking throughout the sciences Head et al. (2015), it is important that these findings are robust to data analysis choices if the conclusion is to be considered unequivocal. Although no evidence of widespread left-skew p-hacking is found in this reanalysis, this does not mean that there is no p-hacking at all. These results nuance the conclusion by Head et al. (2015), indicating that the results are not robust and that the evidence for widespread left-skew p-hacking is ambiguous at best.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:  In psychiatric genetics research, the volume of ambivalent findings on gene-environment interactions (G x E) is growing at an accelerating pace. In response to the surging suspicions of systematic distortion, we challenge the notion of chance capitalization as a possible contributor. Beyond qualifying multiple testing as a mere methodological issue that, if uncorrected, leads to chance capitalization, we advance towards illustrating the potential benefits of multiple tests in understanding equivocal evidence in genetics literature. METHOD:  We focused on the interaction between the serotonin-transporter-linked promotor region (5-HTTLPR) and childhood adversities with regard to depression. After testing 2160 interactions with all relevant measures available within the Dutch population study of adolescents TRAILS, we calculated percentages of significant (p {$<$} .05) effects for several subsets of regressions. Using chance capitalization (i.e. overall significance rate of 5\% alpha and randomly distributed findings) as a competing hypothesis, we expected more significant effects in the subsets of regressions involving: 1) interview-based instead of questionnaire-based measures; 2) abuse instead of milder childhood adversities; and 3) early instead of later adversities. Furthermore, we expected equal significance percentages across 4) male and female subsamples, and 5) various genotypic models of 5-HTTLPR. RESULTS:  We found differences in the percentages of significant interactions among the subsets of analyses, including those regarding sex-specific subsamples and genetic modeling, but often in unexpected directions. Overall, the percentage of significant interactions was 7.9\% which is only slightly above the 5\% that might be expected based on chance. CONCLUSION:  Taken together, multiple testing provides a novel approach to better understand equivocal evidence on G x E, showing that methodological differences across studies are a likely reason for heterogeneity in findings - but chance capitalization is at least equally plausible.},

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.},

  abstract = {Conservation planners need reliable information on spatial patterns of biodiversity. However, existing data sets are skewed because some ecosystems, taxa, and locations are underrepresented. We determined how many articles have been published in recent decades on the biodiversity of different countries and their constituent provinces. We searched the Web of Science catalogues Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for biodiversity-related articles published from 1993 to 2016 that included country and province names. We combined data on research publication frequency with other provincial-scale factors hypothesized to affect the likelihood of research activity (i.e., economic development, human presence, infrastructure, and remoteness). Areas that appeared understudied relative to the biodiversity expected based on site climate likely have been inaccessible to researchers for reasons, notably armed conflict. Geographic publication bias is of most concern in the most remote areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Our provincial-scale model may help compensate for publication biases in conservation planning by revealing the spatial extent of research needs and the low cost of redoing this analysis annually. Efectos del Sesgo de Publicaci{\'o}n sobre la Planeaci{\'o}n de la Conservaci{\'o}n Resumen Los planeadores de la conservaci{\'o}n necesitan informaci{\'o}n confiable sobre los patrones espaciales de la biodiversidad.

Buscamos art{\'i}culos relacionados con la biodiversidad publicados entre 1993 y 2016 que incluyeran el nombre de pa{\'i}ses y provincias en los cat{\'a}logos SCI y SSCI de la Web of Science. Combinamos los datos de frecuencia de publicaci{\'o}n de investigaciones con otros factores de escala provincial que creemos afectar{\'i}an la probabilidad de la actividad de investigaci{\'o}n (es decir, desarrollo econ{\'o}mico, presencia humana, infraestructura y lejan{\'i}a).

This article describes one feasible approach toward this goal--the combining of inductive and deductive modeling techniques with the optimizing power of simple algorithms of Darwinian evolution that include information-theoretic model selection methods. Specifically, the author shows a way to extend classic genetic algorithms beyond typical parameter fitting of a single, previously chosen model to a more flexible technique that can work with a suite of possible models. Inclusion of the Akaike information-theoretic model selection method within an evolutionary algorithm makes it possible to accomplish simultaneous parameter fitting and parsimonious model selection.Experiments with synthetic data show the feasibility of this approach, and experiments with time-series field data of the zebra mussel invasion of Lake Champlain (United States) result in a model of the invasion dynamics that is consistent with the known hydrodynamic features of the lake and the motile life history stage of this invasive species.The author also describes a way to extend this approach with a modified genetic programming algorithm.},

Here, we define a general framework on common sources of uncertainty arising in computational analyses that lead to this multiplicity, and apply this framework within an overview of approaches proposed across disciplines to address the issue. Armed with this framework, and a set of recommendations derived therefrom, researchers will be able to recognize strategies applicable to their field and use them to generate findings more likely to be replicated in future studies, ultimately improving the credibility of the scientific process.},

Despite notable advancements in predictive modeling, spanning core machine learning tasks to various scientific applications, challenges such as overlooked contextual factors, data-dependent decision-making, and unintentional re-use of test data have raised questions about the integrity of results. To address these issues, we propose adapting pre-registration practices from explanatory modeling to predictive modeling. We discuss current best practices in predictive modeling and their limitations, introduce a lightweight pre-registration template, and present a qualitative study with machine learning researchers to gain insight into the e↵ectiveness of pre-registration in preventing biased estimates and promoting more reliable research outcomes. We conclude by exploring the scope of problems that pre-registration can address in predictive modeling and acknowledging its limitations within this context.},

We argue that the discussion sections of all empirical papers should include a subsection that reports post hoc exploratory data analysis. We explain how authors, reviewers, and editors can best leverage post hoc analyses in the spirit of scientific discovery in a way that does not bias parameter estimates and recognizes the lack of definitiveness associated with any single study or any single replication. We also discuss why the failure to Thark in high-stakes contexts where data is scarce and costly may also be unethical.},

  abstract = {Ecological predictions and management strategies are sensitive to variability in model parameters as well as uncertainty in model structure. Systematic analysis of the effect of alternative model structures, however, is often beyond the resources typically available to ecologists, ecological risk practitioners, and natural resource managers. Many of these practitioners are also using Bayesian belief networks based on expert opinion to fill gaps in empirical information. The practical application of this approach can be limited by the need to populate large conditional probability tables and the complexity associated with ecological feedback cycles. In this paper, we describe a modeling approach that helps solve these problems by embedding a qualitative analysis of sign directed graphs into the probabilistic framework of a Bayesian belief network. Our approach incorporates the effects of feedback on the model's response to a sustained change in one or more of its parameters, provides an efficient means to explore the effect of alternative model structures, mitigates the cognitive bias in expert opinion, and is amenable to stakeholder input. We demonstrate our approach by examining two published case studies: a host-parasitoid community centered on a nonnative, agricultural pest of citrus cultivars and the response of an experimental lake mesocosm to nutrient input. Observations drawn from these case studies are used to diagnose alternative model structures and to predict the system's response following management intervention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Developing a systematic phenotypic data analysis pipeline, creating enhanced visualizations, and interpreting the results is crucial to extract meaningful insights from data in making better breeding decisions. Here, we provide an overview of how the Rainfed Rice Breeding (RRB) program at IRRI has leveraged R computational power with open-source resource tools like R Markdown, plotly, LaTeX, and HTML to develop an open-source and end-to-end data analysis workflow and pipeline, and re-designed it to a reproducible document for better interpretations, visualizations and easy sharing with collaborators. RESULTS:  We reported the state-of-the-art implementation of the phenotypic data analysis pipeline and workflow embedded into a well-descriptive document. The developed analytical pipeline is open-source, demonstrating how to analyze the phenotypic data in crop breeding programs with step-by-step instructions. The analysis pipeline shows how to pre-process and check the quality of phenotypic data, perform robust data analysis using modern statistical tools and approaches, and convert it into a reproducible document. Explanatory text with R codes, outputs either in text, tables, or graphics, and interpretation of results are integrated into the unified document. The analysis is highly reproducible and can be regenerated at any time. The analytical pipeline source codes and demo data are available at https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline . CONCLUSION:  The analysis workflow and document presented are not limited to IRRI's RRB program but are applicable to any organization or institute with full-fledged breeding programs. We believe this is a great initiative to modernize the data analysis of IRRI's RRB program. Further, this pipeline can be easily implemented by plant breeders or researchers, helping and guiding them in analyzing the breeding trials data in the best possible way.},

These methods lack a common underlying framework, such that the process is explicit and repeatable, assumptions are highlighted, and commonalities and differences among prioritizations can be readily assessed. Our objective in this paper is to provide such a framework for cases where the goal of setting priorities is to maximize the ecological benefit gained from limited resources. We provide simple and general models that can be used to prioritize sites based on the projected ecological benefit per unit restoration or protection effort and to estimate the total projected benefit of restoring or protecting a set of sites. These models, which are based on an expression of the functional relationship between an end point and effort, hold up under a variety of situations and provide a common language for prioritization. We then discuss procedures for estimating model terms-calculations from regression curves when data are available, and use of judgement indicators when data are relatively limited. Finally, we present two case studies that apply the models and examine selected past prioritizations in the context of our framework.},

Here, we propose a framework that quantifies species' responses across gradients of threat intensity to implement more efficient and better targeted conservation actions. Our framework acknowledges the variation in threat intensities as well as the differences among species in their capacity to respond, and is implemented at a relevant scale for national and international policy-making.},

The protocol may be publicly visible immediately upon deposition or it may remain hidden until the work is completed/published. It may include the analysis plan, outcomes, and/or information about how evaluation of performance (e.g. forecasting ability) will be made, Pre-registration aims to enhance the trust one can put on scientific work. Deviations from the original plan, may still often be desirable, but pre-registration makes them transparent. While pre-registration has been advocated and used to variable extent in diverse types of research, there has been relatively little attention given to the possibility of pre-registration for mathematical modeling studies. Feasibility of pre-registration depends on the type of modeling and the ability to pre-specify processes and outcomes. In some types of modeling, in particular those that involve forecasting or other outcomes that can be appraised in the future, trust in model performance would be enhanced through pre-registration. Pre-registration can also be seen as a component of a larger suite of research practices that aim to improve documentation, transparency, and sharing---eventually allowing better reproducibility of the research work. The current commentary discusses the evolving landscape of the concept of pre-registration as it relates to different mathematical modeling activities, the potential advantages and disadvantages, feasibility issues, and realistic goals.},

However, researchers who conduct replication studies face a difficult problem; there are many more studies in need of replication than there are funds available for replicating. To select studies for replication efficiently, we need to understand which studies are the most in need of replication. In other words, we need to understand which replication efforts have the highest expected utility. In this article we propose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the replication value of the claims considered for replication. The replication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we could gain by replicating the claim, and is a function of (1) the value of being certain about the claim, and (2) uncertainty about the claim based on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal decision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph modeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of expected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative estimates of replication value.},

The harvest scheduling model is solved repeatedly to produce harvest schedules within a rolling planning horizon framework. The risk mitigation strategies we examined were (1) whether or not to account for fire in the planning model and (2) replanning interval. We evaluated those strategies under four representative fire regimes. We found that accounting for fire in the planning model reduced the harvest volume variability as fire activity increased (i. e., for average annual burn fractions {$>$}= 0.45\%), but replanning intervals over a range of 1 to 10 years had little impact on harvest volume variability. We also developed a risk analysis decision-making aid that forest managers can use to help deal with fire-related uncertainty. Our results suggest that risk-averse forest managers should account for fire while planning, especially when burn fractions exceed 0.45\%.},

  abstract = {Question Fire management practices aimed at biodiversity conservation are often in conflict with hazard reduction requirements. Particularly in protected areas where such conflict of interest exists, the question is asked: what are the ecological thresholds within which fire should be managed? Location Montane proteoid fynbos shrublands, eastern coastal part of the Cape Floral Kingdom; coastal slopes of the Tsitsikamma and Outeniqua Mountains, South Africa. Methods Estimates of optimal fire frequencies are often based on the relationship between plant age and the rate of seed accumulation of the slowest-maturing species. We established juvenile periods and recruitment success (measured as the ratio of post-fire recruits to the pre-burn population) after fires at different intervals, of serotinous, reseeding shrubs in the Proteaceae. From this we estimated minimum fire return intervals (FRIs) that would allow for their persistence in eastern coastal fynbos shrublands. Results Juvenile periods ranged from 4 to 9 yr, which are comparable to ecologically similar proteoids elsewhere in fynbos and SE and SW Australian shrublands. There was large variability among sites and within species in the degree of flowering at given plant ages, some of which seemed related to the moisture regime. There were no consistent differences among species in their rate of maturation. Post-fire recruitment success was near zero following a fire in 5-yr-old vegetation, always above replacement levels following fires in =7-yr-old vegetation, and at a maximum in old (38 yr) fynbos. There was considerable variation in post-fire recruitment success for any particular FRI, species or site. The lack of a significant relationship between recruitment success and pre-fire vegetation age, suggests that once a critical post-fire age is attained, factors other than seed abundance affect recruitment success. Conclusions From an ecological perspective, our findings imply a minimum FRI of 9 yr for eastern coastal fynbos. This is not intended to prescribe rigid management of fire according to a fixed rotation and does not negate the need to consider site- or species-specific requirements. Instead it provides a lower threshold for a range of acceptable FRIs below which a significant decline of species populations is predicted.},

Previous behavioral experiments of commons dilemmas have found that people are willing to engage in costly punishment, frequently generating increases in gross benefits, contrary to game-theoretical predictions based on a static pay-off function. Results in our experimental environment find that costly punishment is again used but lacks a gross positive effect on resource harvesting unless combined with communication.

To promote this balance in organizational science, rigor- ous inductive research aimed at phenomenon detection must be further encouraged. To this end, the present article discusses the logic and methods of exploratory data analysis (EDA), the mode of analysis concerned with discovery, exploration, and empirically detecting phe- nomena in data. We begin by first describing the historical and conceptual background of EDA. We then discuss two issues related to EDA and its relationship to scientific credibility. First, we argue that EDA fosters a replication-based science by requiring cross-validation and by emphasizing the natural uncertainty of data patterns. Second, we clarify that EDA is distin- guishable from other exploratory practices that are considered scientifically questionable (e.g., ``p-hacking'', ``data fishing'' and ``data-dredging''). In the following section of the paper, we present a final argument for EDA: that it helps maximize the value of data. To illustrate this point, we present several graphical methods for detecting data patterns and provide refer- ences to further techniques for the interested reader.},

  abstract = {Serotiny, the retention of mature seeds in closed fruits within the canopy for over a year, is a common trait in fire-prone environments. When competition with adult plants prevents seedling establishment between fire events and in the absence of post-release soil seed dormancy, strong serotiny, i.e. the retention of all seeds until the next fire, appears as the best strategy. Despite the low levels of inter-fire seed recruitment for several species in both Australian and South African fire-prone environments, considerable variation in the duration of fruit retention is nevertheless observed among species. * Our aim is to predict optimal age-specific reproductive schedules in a perennial, serotinous species, when cone maintenance is costly. We focus on species where adults are killed by fire, without a soil seed-bank. We explicitly consider a trade-off between growth (which determines plant survival), seed production and seed maintenance. In our model recruitment relies upon fire events. We use dynamic programming to determine, for given fire regimes, the optimal pattern of resource allocation. We further study the effect of changes in fire regime on the viability of populations adapted to some historical fire regime. * We find that, whenever maximal plant survival probability is low, the optimal strategy consists in reducing resource allocation to seed maintenance while increasing resource allocation to annual seed production. This illustrates a trade-off between current and future reproduction. * A low rather than a strong level of serotiny should evolve whenever the variance of fire intervals is large and the mean fire interval is low. Low levels of serotiny could constitute a bet-hedging strategy with decreasing predictability of the arrival of fire. * Once adapted to some historical fire regime, serotinous populations are highly sensitive to a change in mean fire frequency and to an increase in the variance of fire intervals. Populations adapted to a historically high level of variance in fire return are more robust to changes in fire regime. * Synthesis: Life-history trade-offs and low predictability of fire intervals may favour low rather than strong levels of serotiny even when recruitment essentially occurs just after fire events.},

First, the wastewater treatment cost function is estimated and coalition costs are compared to the cost of stand-alone wastewater treatment in each province. Second, two standard and five game theoretical cost allocation schemes are applied to the grand coalition. Results suggest that a cost savings of US \$46.46 million can be obtained by forming a grand coalition. All allocation schemes were found to be acceptable. Results also suggest that both Shanghai and Jiangsu Province would prefer a proportional allocation scheme based on pollutant discharge, because it would offer them the largest cost savings. But this allocation scheme is the least stable one. Based on the criterion of stability, the Nash-Harsanyi scheme emerges as providing the optimal allocation. Finally, calculation of power and stability indexes suggests Jiangsu Province as an agent is critical to the success of grand coalition formation.},

  abstract = {Although succession may follow multiple pathways in a given environment, the causes of such variation are often elusive. This paper describes how changes in fire interval mediate successional trajectory in conifer-dominated boreal forests of northwestern Canada. Tree densities were measured 5 and 19 years after fire in permanent plots and related to pre-fire vegetation, site and fire characteristics. In stands that were greater than 75 years of age when they burned, recruitment density of conifers was significantly correlated with pre-fire species basal area, supporting the expectation of stand self-replacement as the most common successional pathway in these forests. In contrast, stands that were under 25 years of age at the time of burning had significantly reduced conifer recruitment, but showed no change in recruitment of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). As a result, young-burned stands had a much higher probability of regenerating to deciduous dominance than mature-burned stands, despite the dominance of both groups by spruce (Picea mariana and Picea glauca) and pine (Pinus contorta) before the fire. Once initiated, deciduous-dominated stands may be maintained across subsequent fire cycles through mechanisms such as low on-site availability of conifer seed, competition with the aspen canopy, and rapid asexual regeneration of aspen after fire. We suggest that climate-related increases in fire frequency could trigger more frequent shifts from conifer to deciduous-dominated successional trajectories in the future, with consequent effects on multiple ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Conservationfundsaregrosslyinadequatetoaddresstheplightofthreatenedspecies.Government and conservation organizations faced with the task of conserving threatened species desperately need simple strategies for allocating limited resources. The academic literature dedicated to systematic priority setting usually recommends ranking species on several criteria, including level of endangerment and metrics of species value such as evolutionary distinctiveness, ecological importance, and social significance. These approaches ignore 2 crucial factors: the cost of management and the likelihood that the management will succeed. These oversights will result in misallocation of scarce conservation resources and possibly unnecessary losses. We devised a project prioritization protocol (PPP) to optimize resource allocation among New Zealand's threatened-species projects, where costs, benefits (including species values), and the likelihood of management success were considered simultaneously. We compared the number of species managed and the expected benefits gained with 5 prioritization criteria: PPP with weightings based on species value; PPP with species weighted equally; management costs; species value; and threat status. We found that the rational use of cost and success information substantially increased the number of species managed, and prioritizing management projects according to species value or threat status in isolation was inefficient and resulted in fewer species managed. In addition, we found a clear trade-off between funding management of a greater number of the most cost-efficient and least risky projects and funding fewer projects to manage the species of higher value. Specifically, 11 of 32 species projects could be funded if projects were weighted by species value compared with 16 projects if projects were not weighted. This highlights the value of a transparent decision-making process, which enables a careful consideration of trade-offs. The use of PPP can substantially improve conservation outcomes for threatened species by increasing efficiency and ensuring transparency of management decisions.},

  abstract = {1Callitris verrucosa is an obligate-seeder co-dominant within flammable semi-arid mallee shrublands in southern Australia. We sought to determine if there is an optimal management solution that provides both a significant reduction in wildfire size and maintains a viable population of C. verrucosa. Using a spatial model, the effects of alternative fire management strategies (pattern and level of prescribed burning) on populations of C. verrucosa were simulated. * 2Plant dynamics and fire propagation were simulated in a gridded landscape model (104 cells, c. 1~ha) incorporating topographic variation typical of dune landscapes. Fire propagation was governed by fuel age, and topographic and weather effects, incorporating potential for spot fires and the influence of wind direction. Plant dynamics were determined by known demographic parameters for C. verrucosa. * 3The size of unplanned fires declined significantly as a function of increasing prescribed burning level. Mean fire interval was longer at zero or 1\% per year of landscape treated with prescribed fire than at higher levels of prescribed burning. Mean fire intervals were shorter under the highest probability of unplanned ignition in the flat landscape and in the dune landscape on the slopes. * 4The responses of C. verrucosa populations reflected trends in fire intervals as affected by prescribed burning levels/patterns and topography. The lowest population sizes resulted from either high (20\% per year) or zero prescribed burning. The highest population sizes occurred consistently at an intermediate level of prescribed ignition (5\% per year). Population sizes were significantly larger in dune vs. flat landscapes and under random vs. non-random prescribed ignition patterns. * 5Synthesis and applications. The use of prescribed fire to achieve management objectives concerning `wildfire control' and conservation will involve trade-offs that are affected by landscape characteristics. Prescribed fire is predicted to achieve both a diminution of wildfire size and maintenance of C. verrucosa population in the landscape. The trade-off required to achieve these objectives concerns the appropriate level and pattern of prescribed fire (strategy).},

Previous research has shown that participants may underweight information incompatible with previous choices, a phenomenon called confirmation bias. In this paper we argue that a similar bias exists in the way information is actively sought. We investigate how choice influences information gathering using a perceptual choice task and find that participants sample more information from a previously chosen alternative. Furthermore, the higher the confidence in the initial choice, the more biased information sampling becomes. As a consequence, when faced with the possibility of revising an earlier decision, participants are more likely to stick with their original choice, even when incorrect. Critically, we show that agency controls this phenomenon. The effect disappears in a fixed sampling condition where presentation of evidence is controlled by the experimenter, suggesting that the way in which confirmatory evidence is acquired critically impacts the decision process. These results suggest active information acquisition plays a critical role in the propagation of strongly held beliefs over time.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Meta-analysis and meta-regression are often highly cited and may influence practice. Unfortunately, statistical errors in meta-analyses are widespread and can lead to flawed conclusions. The purpose of this article was to review common statistical errors in meta-analyses and to document their frequency in highly cited meta-analyses from strength and conditioning research. METHODS: We identified five errors in one highly cited meta-regression from strength and conditioning research: implausible outliers; overestimated effect sizes that arise from confusing standard deviation with standard error; failure to account for correlated observations; failure to account for within-study variance; and a focus on within-group rather than between-group results. We then quantified the frequency of these errors in 20 of the most highly cited meta-analyses in the field of strength and conditioning research from the past 20~years. RESULTS: We found that 85\% of the 20 most highly cited meta-analyses in strength and conditioning research contained statistical errors. Almost half (45\%) contained at least one effect size that was mistakenly calculated using standard error rather than standard deviation. In several cases, this resulted in obviously wrong effect sizes, for example, effect sizes of 11 or 14 standard deviations. Additionally, 45\% failed to account for correlated observations despite including numerous effect sizes from the same study and often from the same group within the same study. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical errors in meta-analysis and meta-regression are common in strength and conditioning research. We highlight five errors that authors, editors, and readers should check for when preparing or critically reviewing meta-analyses. {\copyright} 2022. The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Human activities both depend upon and have consequences on the environment. Environmental risk assessment (ERA) is a process of estimating the probability and consequences of the adverse effects of human activities and other stressors on the environment. Bayesian networks (BNs) can synthesize different types of knowledge and explicitly account for the probabilities of different scenarios, therefore offering a useful tool for ERA. Their use in formal ERA practice has not been evaluated, however, despite their increasing popularity in environmental modeling. This paper reviews the use of BNs in ERA based on peer-reviewed publications. Following a systematic mapping protocol, we identified studies in which BNs have been used in an environmental risk context and evaluated the scope, technical aspects, and use of the models and their results. The review shows that BNs have been applied in ERA, particularly in recent years, and that there is room to develop both the model implementation and participatory modeling practices. Based on this review and the authors' experience, we outline general guidelines and development ideas for using BNs in ERA. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;17:62--78. {\copyright} 2020 The Authors.

Though numerous analysis and visualization tools have been built to improve the scale and efficiency at which analysts can work, there has been little research on how analysis takes place within the social and organizational context of companies. To better understand the enterprise analysts' ecosystem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 data analysts from 25 organizations across a variety of sectors, including healthcare, retail, marketing and finance. Based on our interview data, we characterize the process of industrial data analysis and document how organizational features of an enterprise impact it. We describe recurring pain points, outstanding challenges, and barriers to adoption for visual analytic tools. Finally, we discuss design implications and opportunities for visual analysis research.},

Introduction The explosive growth of data available on the World Wide Web has made this the largest publicly accessible data-bank in the world. Therefore, it presents an unprecedented opportunity for data mining and knowledge discovery. Web mining, which is a field of science that aims to discover useful knowledge from information that is available over the internet, can be classified into three categories, depending on the mining goals and the information garnered: web structure mining, web usage mining, and web content mining [1]. Web structure mining extracts patterns from the linking structures between pages, and presents the web * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: khalilsalim1@gmail.com (S. Khalil), fakfad@yahoo.fr (M. Fakir). abstract RCrawler is a contributed R package for domain-based web crawling and content scraping. As the first implementation of a parallel web crawler in the R environment, RCrawler can crawl, parse, store pages, extract contents, and produce data that can be directly employed for web content mining applications. However, it is also flexible, and could be adapted to other applications. The main features of RCrawler are multi-threaded crawling, content extraction, and duplicate content detection. In addition, it includes functionalities such as URL and content-type filtering, depth level controlling, and a robot.txt parser. Our crawler has a highly optimized system, and can download a large number of pages per second while being robust against certain crashes and spider traps. In this paper, we describe the design and functionality of RCrawler, and report on our experience of implementing it in an R environment, including different optimizations that handle the limitations of R. Finally, we discuss our experimental results.},

  abstract = {The literature on the science-policy interface suggests that stakeholders' perceptions of environmental planning and decision-making processes can affect the uptake of conserva- tion plans. Despite calls for more and better stakeholder engagement in conservation planning there is currently no empirical evidence on participants' perceptions of such processes. We asked participants of a conservation planning process and other key infor- mants to evaluate their engagement experiences using normative governance principles (legitimacy, inclusiveness, fairness, accountability, integration, adaptability, transparency and capability). We analysed a large-scale case-study of species prioritization in Queensland, Australia. Conceptually, our systematic use of governance principles to interrogate percep- tions of engagement showcased the utility of this analytical approach to uncover important issues influencing science-policy uptake. Empirically, we showed that there remains consid- erable debate about how a normative conservation planning process should be. Our data revealed different interpretations of species prioritization, ranging from a deliberative pro- cess to define priorities in biodiversity conservation, to a technical, expert-based process. Matters of `who' was included affected stakeholders' perceptions of species prioritization. Perceived limitations of `how' the process was conducted were also important, affected by the: (1) institutional culture of the Queensland Government; (2) lack of transparency; (3) limited flexibility to incorporate both emerging data and participants' suggestions in pro- gramme management; and (4) limited capability for implementation. These empirical data support existing evidence from studies in the broader field of collaborative planning. We draw from this literature to suggest how conservation planners can overcome the barriers to the uptake of prioritization priorities identified in or research.

Yet, data collection errors are common, and data analysis often lags far enough behind its collection that many errors can no longer be corrected, nor can anomalous observations be revisited. Needed is a system in which data quality assurance and control (QA/QC), along with the production of basic data summaries, can be automated immediately following data collection.                                                     Here, we implement and test a system to satisfy these needs. For two annual tree mortality censuses and a dendrometer band survey at two forest research sites, we used GitHub Actions continuous integration (CI) to automate data QA/QC and run routine data wrangling scripts to produce cleaned datasets ready for analysis.                                                     This system automation had numerous benefits, including (1) the production of near real-time information on data collection status and errors requiring correction, resulting in final datasets free of detectable errors, (2) an apparent learning effect among field technicians, wherein original error rates in field data collection declined significantly following implementation of the system, and (3) an assurance of computational reproducibility---that is, robustness of the system to changes in code, data and software.                                                     By implementing CI, researchers can ensure that datasets are free of any errors for which a test can be coded. The result is dramatically improved data quality, increased skill among field technicians, and reduced need for expert oversight. Furthermore, we view CI implementation as a first step towards a data collection~and analysis pipeline that is also more responsive to rapidly changing ecological dynamics, making it better suited to study ecological systems in the current era of rapid environmental change.},

Collecting more data is important, but we can also make better use of existing information. Prior knowledge of physiology, life history, and community ecology can be used to inform population models. Additionally, in multispecies models, information can be shared among taxa based on phylogenetic, spatial, or temporal proximity. By exploiting generalities across species that share evolutionary or ecological characteristics within Bayesian hierarchical models, we can fill crucial gaps in the assessment of species' status with unparalleled quantitative rigor.},

The framework is a synthesis of three conceptual models previously developed by sev- eral rangeland and restoration ecologists. We focus first on distinctions and connections between structural and functional components of rangeland ecosystems and then on distinctions and connections between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem. We next show that the structural/functional and biotic/abiotic distinctions can be integrated with a stepwise, positive feedback model of de- gradation to help explain degradation processes and resto- ration approaches. Finally, we relate those concepts to a threshold model of rangeland degradation. By establish- ing the conceptual links among these different models, this synthesis provides a broader, more integrated framework for thinking about the dynamics involved in rangeland deg- radation and restoration. We conclude by presenting some approaches to restoration that are motivated by the suite of concepts that are brought together in the framework.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES:  General frameworks for conducting and reporting health economic evaluations are available but not specific enough to cover the intricacies of the evaluation of diagnostic tests and biomarkers. Such evaluations are typically complex and model-based because tests primarily affect health outcomes indirectly and real-world data on health outcomes are often lacking. Moreover, not all aspects relevant to the evaluation of a diagnostic test may be known and explicitly considered for inclusion in the evaluation, leading to a loss of transparency and replicability. To address this challenge, this study aims to develop a comprehensive reporting checklist. METHODS:  This study consisted of 3 main steps: 1) the development of an initial checklist based on a scoping review, 2) review and critical appraisal of the initial checklist by 4 independent experts, and 3) development of a final checklist. Each item from the checklist is illustrated using an example from previous research. RESULTS:  The scoping review followed by critical review by the 4 experts resulted in a checklist containing 44 items, which ideally should be considered for inclusion in a model-based health economic evaluation. The extent to which these items were included or discussed in the studies identified in the scoping review varied substantially, with 14 items not being mentioned in {$\geq$}47 (75\%) of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS:  The reporting checklist developed in this study may contribute to improved transparency and completeness of model-based health economic evaluations of diagnostic tests and biomarkers. Use of this checklist is therefore encouraged to enhance the interpretation, comparability, and-indirectly-the validity of the results of such evaluations.},

  abstract = {A growing interest in understanding complex and dynamic psychological processes as they occur in everyday life has led to an increase in studies using ambulatory assessment techniques, including the experience-sampling method (ESM) and ecological momentary assessment. These methods, however, tend to involve numerous forking paths and researcher degrees of freedom, even beyond those typically encountered with other research methodologies. Although a number of researchers working with ESM techniques are actively engaged in efforts to increase the methodological rigor and transparency of research that uses them, currently there is little routine implementation of open-science practices in ESM research. In this article, we discuss the ways in which ESM research is especially vulnerable to threats to transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. We propose that greater use of study registration, a cornerstone of open science, may address some of these threats to the transparency of ESM research. Registration of ESM research is not without challenges, including model selection, accounting for potential model-convergence issues, and the use of preexisting data sets. As these may prove to be significant barriers for ESM researchers, we also discuss ways of overcoming these challenges and of documenting them in a registration. A further challenge is that current general preregistration templates do not adequately capture the unique features of ESM. We present a registration template for ESM research and also discuss registration of studies using preexisting data.},

  abstract = {The literature discusses causes of low reproducibility of scientific publications. Our article adds another main cause-uncritical adherence to accepted research procedures. This is evident in: (1) anachronistically requiring researchers to base themselves on theoretical background even if the studies cited were not tested for reproducibility; (2) conducting studies suffering from a novelty effect bias; (3) forcing researchers who use data mining methods and field-based theory, with no preliminary theoretical rationale, to present a theoretical background that allegedly guided their work-as a precondition for publication of their findings. It is possible to increase research validity in relation to the above problems by the following means: (1) Conducting a longitudinal study on the same participants and only on them; (2) Trying to shorten the time period between laboratory experiments and those on humans, based on cost-benefit considerations, anchored in ethical norms; (3) Reporting the theoretical background in a causal modular format; (4) Giving incentives to those who meet the above criteria while moderating the pressure for fast output.},

The research discussed in this paper lies at the intersection of spatial and behavioral sciences, two of the greatest beneficiaries of crowd science. As a young methodological development, crowd science needs attention from the perspective of a rigorous evaluation of the data collected to explore potentials as well as limitations (pitfalls). Our research has addressed a variety of contextual effects on the validity of crowdsourced data such as cultural, linguistic, regional, as well as methodological differences that we will discuss here in light of semantics.},

  abstract = {Conservation assessment is a rapidly evolving discipline whose stated goal is the design of networks of protected areas that represent and ensure the persistence of nature (i.e., species, habitats, and environmental processes) by separating priority areas from the activities that degrade or destroy them. Nevertheless, despite a burgeoning scientific literature that ever refines these techniques for allocating conservation resources, it is widely believed that conservation assessments are rarely translated into actions that actually conserve nature. We reviewed the conservation assessment literature in peer-reviewed journals and conducted survey questionnaires of the authors of these studies. Two-thirds of conservation assessments published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature do not deliver conservation action, primarily because most researchers never plan for implementation. This research-implementation gap between conservation science and real-world action is a genuine phenomenon and is a specific example of the "knowing-doing gap" that is widely recognized in management science. Given the woefully inadequate resources allocated for conservation, our findings raise questions over the utility of conservation assessment science, as currently practiced, to provide useful, pragmatic solutions to conservation planning problems. A reevaluation of the conceptual and operational basis of conservation planning research is urgently required. We recommend the following actions for beginning a process for bridging the research-implementation gap in conservation planning: (1) acknowledge the research-implementation gap is real, (2) source research questions from practitioners, (3) situate research within a broader conservation planning model, (4) expand the social dimension of conservation assessments, (5) support conservation plans with transdisciplinary social learning institutions, (6) reward academics for societal engagement and implementation, and (7) train students in skills for "doing" conservation.},

  abstract = {Exposure to fine ambient particulate matter (PM) has consistently been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The relationship between exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) and health effects is less firmly established. If UFP cause health effects independently from coarser fractions, this could affect health impact assessment of air pollution, which would possibly lead to alternative policy options to be considered to reduce the disease burden of PM. Therefore, we organized an expert elicitation workshop to assess the evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to UFP and health endpoints. An expert elicitation on the health effects of ambient ultrafine particle exposure was carried out, focusing on: 1) the likelihood of causal relationships with key health endpoints, and 2) the likelihood of potential causal pathways for cardiac events. Based on a systematic peer-nomination procedure, fourteen European experts (epidemiologists, toxicologists and clinicians) were selected, of whom twelve attended. They were provided with a briefing book containing key literature. After a group discussion, individual expert judgments in the form of ratings of the likelihood of causal relationships and pathways were obtained using a confidence scheme adapted from the one used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The likelihood of an independent causal relationship between increased short-term UFP exposure and increased all-cause mortality, hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, aggravation of asthma symptoms and lung function decrements was rated medium to high by most experts. The likelihood for long-term UFP exposure to be causally related to all cause mortality, cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and lung cancer was rated slightly lower, mostly medium. The experts rated the likelihood of each of the six identified possible causal pathways separately. Out of these six, the highest likelihood was rated for the pathway involving respiratory inflammation and subsequent thrombotic effects. The overall medium to high likelihood rating of causality of health effects of UFP exposure and the high likelihood rating of at least one of the proposed causal mechanisms explaining associations between UFP and cardiac events, stresses the importance of considering UFP in future health impact assessments of (transport-related) air pollution, and the need for further research on UFP exposure and health effects.},

However, if the reported results are intentionally biased, hypothesis testing no longer controls the rate of false discovery.

When the number of possible configurations (e.g., datasets) is large, we show that the reporter can falsely report an innovation even if there is no improvement at all. We propose a `post-reporting' solution to this issue where the bias of the reported results is verified by another set of results.

An alternative approach through Bayesian statistics provides var- ious degrees of support for any hypothesis allowing balanced decisions and proper null hypothesis testing, which may prevent publication bias. Testing a null hypothesis becomes increasingly relevant in mediated communication and virtual environments. To illustrate our arguments, we re-analyzed three data sets of previously published data --media violence effects, mediated communication, and visuospatial abilities across genders. Results are discussed in view of possible Bayesian interpreta- tions, which are more open to a content-related argumentation of varying levels of support. Finally, we discuss potential pitfalls of a Bayesian approach such as BF-hacking (cf., ``God would love a Bayes Factor of 3.01 nearly as much as a BF of 2.99''). Especially when BF values are small, replication studies and Bayesian updating are still necessary to draw conclusions.},

  abstract = {Trillions of microbes live within the human gut and influence our health. In particular, these microbes can modify food and drugs into compounds (metabolites) that humans cannot produce on their own. These compounds are often beneficial to the human host, but in some cases -- for example, if the modification alters how a drug works -- can be detrimental. Digoxin is a toxic chemical produced by plants that, in low doses, can be used to treat heart conditions. It has been known for decades that the human gut bacterium Eggerthella lenta transforms digoxin into a metabolite that is an ineffective drug. Microbes use biological catalysts called enzymes to produce metabolites, but it was not known which enzymes enable E. lenta to modify digoxin. Using biochemical and genomic techniques, Koppel et al. now show that an enzyme called Cgr2 inactivates digoxin and other related plant toxins. Data about the gut microbes in nearly 1,900 people from three continents revealed that bacteria that can produce Cgr2 were present in the guts of more than 40\% of the individuals, although often in low abundance. Further experiments did not reveal any obvious benefits that E. lenta gains from modifying digoxin. Instead, Koppel et al. propose that the bacteria carry out this modification to protect their human host from plant toxins. The results presented by Koppel et al. emphasise that the activities of gut microbes should be considered when designing new drugs or assessing how they work in the human body. The strategies used to identify Cgr2 could now be applied to discover other important gut microbe-drug interactions. Ultimately, this knowledge will help us to predict and control the activities of gut microbes in ways that could improve human health.},

In order to test this hypothesis, we have conducted five experiments in which participants were exposed to different information about probabilities of fictional events. The results of all experiments support the hypothesis: The lower the probability of an event, the stronger participants embrace conspiratorial explanations. Conspiratorial thinking, we conclude, potentially represents a cognitive heuristic: A coping mechanism for uncertainty.},

The utility maximization problem is one form of a covering problem where multiple criteria can represent the expected social benefits of conservation action. This approach allows flexibility with a problem formulation that is more general than typical reserve design problems, though the solution methods are very similar. However, few studies have addressed optimization in utility maximization problems for conservation planning, and the effect of solution procedure is largely unquantified. Therefore, this study mapped five criteria describing elements of multifunctional agriculture to determine a hypothetical conservation resource allocation plan for agricultural land conservation in the Central Valley of CA, USA. We compared solution procedures within the utility maximization framework to determine the difference between an open source integer programming approach and a greedy heuristic, and find gains from optimization of up to 12\%. We also model land availability for conservation action as a stochastic process and determine the decline in total utility compared to the globally optimal set using both solution algorithms. Our results are comparable to other studies illustrating the benefits of optimization for different conservation planning problems, and highlight the importance of maximizing the effectiveness of limited funding for conservation and natural resource management.},

  abstract = {Human land use is fragmenting habitats worldwide and inhibiting dispersal among previously connected populations of organisms, often leading to inbreeding depression and reduced evolutionary potential in the face of rapid environmental change. One management practice used to combat this is the augmentation of isolated populations with immigrants as a means of demographic and genetic rescue. Augmentation with immigrants that are genetically and adaptively similar to the target population is highly effective at increasing population fitness, but if immigrants are very genetically or adaptively divergent, augmentation can lead to outbreeding depression. Despite well-cited guidelines for the {\texthorizontalbar}best practice{\textbardbl} selection of immigrant sources, often only highly divergent populations remain, and experimental tests of these {\texthorizontalbar}riskier{\textbardbl} augmentation scenarios are essentially nonexistent. Here, we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we used Trinidadian guppies to test the multigenerational demographic and genetic effects of augmenting two target populations with three types of divergent immigrants. We found no evidence for demographic rescue, but we did observe genetic rescue in one population. Specifically, divergent immigrant treatments tended to maintain greater genetic diversity, abundance, and hybrid fitness than controls that received immigrants from the source used to seed the mesocosms. In the second population, divergent immigrants had a slightly negative effect in one treatment, and the benefits of augmentation were less apparent overall, likely because this population started with higher genetic diversity and a lower reproductive rate that limited genetic admixture. Our results add to a growing consensus that gene flow can increase population fitness even when immigrants are more highly divergent, helping to reduce uncertainty about the use of augmentation in applied conservation.},

Research on the reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can provide objective conclusions. DISCUSSION:  The present article highlights the need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the meta-analysis, including quotes from articles to specify how effect sizes were calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be peer-reviewed using novel 'registered report' formats) can be used to distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the amount of criticism after the results are known. The recommendations put forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. In addition, they have the benefit of "future-proofing" meta-analyses by allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed. Adoption of these practices will lead to increased credibility of meta-analytic conclusions, and facilitate cumulative scientific knowledge.},

Taking into account this broad range of services to attain cost-effective ESS delivery is an important challenge facing integrated pond management. To assess the strengths and weaknesses of an ESS approach to support decisions in integrated pond management, we applied it on a small case study in Flanders, Belgium. A Bayesian belief network model was developed to assess ESS delivery under three alternative pond management scenarios: intensive fish farming (IFF), extensive fish farming (EFF) and nature conservation management (NCM). A probabilistic cost-benefit analysis was performed that includes both costs associated with pond management practices and benefits associated with ESS delivery. Whether or not a particular ESS is included in the analysis affects the identification of the most preferable management scenario by the model. Assessing the delivery of a more complete set of ecosystem services tends to shift the results away from intensive management to more biodiversity-oriented management scenarios. The proposed methodology illustrates the potential of Bayesian belief networks. BBNs facilitate knowledge integration and their modular nature encourages future model expansion to more encompassing sets of services. Yet, we also illustrate the key weaknesses of such exercises, being that the choice whether or not to include a particular ecosystem service may determine the suggested optimal management practice.},

Fifteen research teams independently designed studies to answer five original research questions related to moral judgments, negotiations, and implicit cognition. Participants from 2 separate large samples (total N {$>$} 15,000) were then randomly assigned to complete 1 version of each study. Effect sizes varied dramatically across different sets of materials designed to test the same hypothesis: Materials from different teams rendered statistically significant effects in opposite directions for 4 of 5 hypotheses, with the narrowest range in estimates being d = -0.37 to + 0.26. Meta-analysis and a Bayesian perspective on the results revealed overall support for 2 hypotheses and a lack of support for 3 hypotheses. Overall, practically none of the variability in effect sizes was attributable to the skill of the research team in designing materials, whereas considerable variability was attributable to the hypothesis being tested. In a forecasting survey, predictions of other scientists were significantly correlated with study results, both across and within hypotheses. Crowdsourced testing of research hypotheses helps reveal the true consistency of empirical support for a scientific claim. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

We suggest the need for a new organisation to undertake quality reviews and audits of important scientific results that underpin government spending decisions on the environment.

  abstract = {Successfully applying theoretical models to natural communities and predicting ecosystem behavior under changing conditions is the backbone of predictive ecology. However, the experiments required to test these models are dictated by practical constraints, and models are often opportunistically validated against data for which they were never intended. Alternatively, we can inform and improve experimental design by an in-depth pre-experimental analysis of the model, generating experiments better targeted at testing the validity of a theory. Here, we describe this process for a specific experiment. Starting from food web ecological theory, we formulate a model and design an experiment to optimally test the validity of the theory, supplementing traditional design considerations with model analysis. The experiment itself will be run and described in a separate paper. The theory we test is that trophic population dynamics are dictated by species traits, and we study this in a community of terrestrial arthropods. We depart from the Allometric Trophic Network (ATN) model and hypothesize that including habitat use, in addition to body mass, is necessary to better model trophic interactions. We therefore formulate new terms which account for micro-habitat use as well as intra- and interspecific interference in the ATN model. We design an experiment and an effective sampling regime to test this model and the underlying assumptions about the traits dominating trophic interactions. We arrive at a detailed sampling protocol to maximize information content in the empirical data obtained from the experiment and, relying on theoretical analysis of the proposed model, explore potential shortcomings of our design. Consequently, since this is a "pre-experimental" exercise aimed at improving the links between hypothesis formulation, model construction, experimental design and data collection, we hasten to publish our findings before analyzing data from the actual experiment, thus setting the stage for strong inference.},

This approach mirrors the historical development of the field, but it has several shortcomings as a way to present ecological theory. First, the classical equations can appear disconnected from one another. Second, differences in the parameters and styles of the equations do not lend themselves to comparison in a common graphical form. And third, the set of equations as they are commonly presented provides no easy way to see whether any concepts are left out. In fact, something is left out that is not commonly taught: the concept of faster-than-exponential growth approaching a singularity, which is important for understanding rapidly growing systems. In the present article, we demonstrate a unified approach that simplifies the traditional equations of ecology, expands their scope, and emphasizes their interconnections.},

Numerous causes of the crisis have been identified, such as underpowered studies, publication bias, imprecise theories, and inadequate statistical procedures. The replication crisis is real, but it is less clear how it should be resolved. Here we examine potential solutions by modeling a scientific community under various different replication regimes. In one regime, all findings are replicated before publication to guard against subsequent replication failures. In an alternative regime, individual studies are published and are replicated after publication, but only if they attract the community's interest. We find that the publication of potentially non-replicable studies minimizes cost and maximizes efficiency of knowledge gain for the scientific community under a variety of assumptions. Provided it is properly managed, our findings suggest that low replicability can support robust and efficient science.},

Forecasts are now widely produced, enabling proactive management for many applied ecological problems. However, despite numerous calls for an increased emphasis on prediction in ecology, the potential for forecasting to accelerate ecological theory development remains underrealized.                                                     Here, we provide a conceptual framework describing how ecological forecasts can energize and advance ecological theory. We emphasize the many opportunities for future progress in this area through increased forecast development, comparison and synthesis.                                                     Our framework describes how a forecasting approach can shed new light on existing ecological theories while also allowing researchers to address novel questions. Through rigorous and repeated testing of hypotheses, forecasting can help to refine theories and understand their generality across systems. Meanwhile, synthesizing across forecasts allows for the development of novel theory about the relative predictability of ecological variables across forecast horizons and scales.                                                     We envision a future where forecasting is integrated as part of the toolset used in fundamental ecology. By outlining the relevance of forecasting methods to ecological theory, we aim to decrease barriers to entry and broaden the community of researchers using forecasting for fundamental ecological insight.},

However, the stateful nature of lazy evaluation makes it hard to analyze a program's computational cost, either informally or formally. In this work, we present a novel and simple framework for formally reasoning about lazy computation costs based on a recent model of lazy evaluation: clairvoyant call-by-value. The key feature of our framework is its simplicity, as expressed by our definition of the clairvoyance monad. This monad is both simple to define (around 20 lines of Coq) and simple to reason about. We show that this monad can be effectively used to mechanically reason about the computational cost of lazy functional programs written in Coq.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:title{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/jats:title{$><$}jats:p{$>$}Since its introduction by Glass in the 1970s, meta-analysis has become a widely accepted and the most preferred approach to conducting research synthesis. Overcoming the weaknesses commonly associated with traditional narrative review and vote counting, meta-analysis is a statistical method of systematically aggregating and analyzing empirical studies by following well-established procedures. The findings of a meta-analysis, when appropriately conducted, are able to inform important policy decisions and provide practical pedagogical suggestions. With the growing number of publications employing meta-analysis across a wide variety of disciplines, it has received criticism due to its inconsistent findings derived from multiple meta-analyses in the same research domain. These inconsistencies have arisen partly due to the alternatives available to meta-analysts in each major meta-analytic procedure. Researchers have therefore recommended transparent reporting on the decision-making for every essential judgment call so that the results across multiple meta-analyses become replicable, consistent, and interpretable. This research explored the degree to which meta-analyses in the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) discipline transparently reported their decisions in every critical step. To achieve this aim, we retrieved 15 eligible meta-analyses in CALL published between 2003 and 2015. Features of these meta-analyses were extracted based on a codebook modified from Cooper (2003) and Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou and Kern (2012). A transparency score of reporting was then calculated to examine the degree to which these meta-analyses are compliant with the norms of reporting as recommended in the literature. We then discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the methodologies and provide suggestions for conducting quality meta-analyses in this domain.},

  abstract = {A Poisson process is a commonly used starting point for modeling stochastic variation of ecological count data around a theoretical expectation. However, data typically show more variation than implied by the Poisson distribution. Such overdispersion is often accounted for by using models with different assumptions about how the variance changes with the expectation. The choice of these assumptions can naturally have apparent consequences for statistical inference. We propose a parameterization of the negative binomial distribution, where two overdispersion parameters are introduced to allow for various quadratic mean--variance relationships, including the ones assumed in the most commonly used approaches. Using bird migration as an example, we present hypothetical scenarios on how overdispersion can arise due to sampling, flocking behavior or aggregation, environmental variability, or combinations of these factors. For all considered scenarios, mean--variance relationships can be appropriately described by the negative binomial distribution with two overdispersion parameters. To illustrate, we apply the model to empirical migration data with a high level of overdispersion, gaining clearly different model fits with different assumptions about mean--variance relationships. The proposed framework can be a useful approximation for modeling marginal distributions of independent count data in likelihood-based analyses.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity offsetting is widely applied but its effectiveness is rarely assessed. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nest box program intended to offset clearing of hollow-bearing trees associated with a freeway upgrade in southern Australia. The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of nest boxes in nearby woodland (1:1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 nest boxes in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of nest boxes. For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of nest box use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (0--0.76\% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of nest boxes by the squirrel glider (0--2.1\% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period). Rates of nest box use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations. Low levels of use by target species coupled with the extent of nest box attrition suggest the offset program will not have counterbalanced the loss of the hollow-bearing trees. We make suggestions for improving future offset programs including a greater emphasis on: (1) avoiding impacts on hollow-bearing trees; (2) offset effectiveness as a measure of compliance; and (3) using realistic offset ratios.},

One useful criterion for model selection is generalizability; that is, the chosen model should yield the best predictions for future data. Some researchers in psychology have proposed that the Bayes factor can be used for assessing model generalizability. An alternative method, known as the generalization criterion, has also been proposed for the same purpose. We argue that these two methods address different levels of model generalizability (local and global), and will often produce divergent conclusions. We illustrate this divergence by applying the Bayes factor and the generalization criterion to a comparison of retention functions. The application of alternative model selection criteria will also be demonstrated within the framework of model generalizability.},

However, limited available data and the lack of reliable absence data have become a major challenge to overcome. At least two approaches have been proposed to generate pseudo-absences; however it is not clear how the number of pseudo-absences created affect model performance. Moreover, the spatial bias in the collecting localities of a species (presence data) may add extra noise to the final distribution model. Here, we use a virtual species to assess the effects of spatial sampling bias, and number and location of pseudo-absences on model accuracy. We found that both number of pseudo-absences and spatial bias in sampling localities, as well as their interac- tion, significantly influence all accuracy measures (AUC, sensitivity, and specificity). However, location of pseudo-absences (either generated across the entire study area or only outside the environmental envelope of the species) does not affect model performance. These results provide some methodological guidelines for developing reliable distribution hypotheses when presence data are scarce.},

One key to reforming science is a simple and scalable practice: pre-registration. Pre-registration constitutes pre-specifying an analysis plan prior to data collection. A growing chorus of articles discusses the prescriptive, field-wide benefits of preregistration. To increase adoption, however, scientists need to know who currently pre-registers and under\- stand perceived barriers to doing so. Thus, we weigh costs and benefits of pre-registration. Our survey of re\- searchers reveals generational differences in who pre-registers and uncertainty regarding how pre-registration benefits individual researchers. We leverage these data to directly address researchers' uncertainty by clarifying why pre-registration improves the research process itself. Finally, we discuss how to pre-register and compare available resources. The present work examines the who, why, and how of pre-registration in order to weigh the costs and benefits of pre-registration to researchers and motivate continued adoption.},

To bring more clarity to this debate, we conducted a comparative analysis of the available literature, focussing on potential biases. Location: Worldwide. Methods: We performed a systematic review to identify studies testing the island rule and translated these studies' outcomes, so that they follow a consistent approach. The studies were assessed for differences in their analysis of the island rule. We cre- ated an authorship network showing who published studies with whom on the topic and weighted the data based on co-authorship and number of publications. Results: We identified 143 relevant studies, finding a significantly lower frequency of supporting studies according to our consistent approach (50\%) than the authors' own statements (59\%). Two core-author groups could be identified with a strong publication record on the island rule. The first group has predominately published studies supporting the rule, whereas the other group has mainly published studies questioning it. According to a subsequent analysis excluding studies with a high risk of HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known), the frequency of studies supporting the rule further dropped to 42\%. Main conclusions: Empirical support for the island rule is low, especially for non- mammalian taxa and when using a consistent evaluation approach. Differences among studies in supporting versus questioning this hypothesis seem to be partly due to author-related biases. Methods to address potential biases in studying eco- logical hypotheses are urgently needed. We offer such a method here.},

On the basis of these studies, we propose a consensus on evidence-based rather than idiosyncratic criteria, including clear guidelines on reporting details.

A specific definition is developed, a working model of classification for publication bias is proposed, and an assessment of what we can measure is described. Finally, we offer expectations for ecologists with respect to the significance of bias in the publication process within our discipline. We argue that without explicit consideration of both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of publication bias in ecology, we limit our capacity to fairly assess and best use the science that we as a community produce.},

  abstract = {Data support knowledge development and theory advances in ecology and evolution. We are increasingly reusing data within our teams and projects and through the global, openly archived datasets of others. Metadata can be challenging to write and interpret, but it is always crucial for reuse. The value metadata cannot be overstated---\- even as a relatively independent research object because it describes the work that has been done in a structured format. We advance a new perspective and classify methods for metadata curation and development with tables. Tables with templates can be effectively used to capture all components of an experiment or project in a single, easy-\-to-\-read file familiar to most scientists. If coupled with the R programming language, metadata from tables can then be rapidly and reproducibly converted to publication formats including extensible markup language files suitable for data repositories. Tables can also be used to summarize existing metadata and store metadata across many datasets. A case study is provided and the added benefits of tables for metadata, a priori, are developed to ensure a more streamlined publishing process for many data repositories used in ecology, evolution, and the environmental sciences. In ecology and evolution, researchers are often highly tabular thinkers from experimental data collection in the lab and/or field, and representations of metadata as a table will provide novel research and reuse insights.},

We show that I-T methods are more informative even in single variable problems and we provide an ecological example. 2. I-T methods allow inferences to be made from multiple models simultaneously. We believe multimodel inference is the future of data analysis, which cannot be achieved with null hypothesis-testing approaches. 3. We argue for a stronger emphasis on critical thinking in science in general and less reliance on exploratory data analysis and data dredging. Deriving alternative hypotheses is central to science; deriving a single interesting science hypothesis and then comparing it to a default null hypothesis (e.g. 'no difference') is not an efficient strategy for gaining knowledge. We think this single-hypothesis strategy has been relied upon too often in the past. 4. We clarify misconceptions presented by Stephens et al. (2005). 5. We think inference should be made about models, directly linked to scientific hypotheses, and their parameters conditioned on data, \$Prob(H\_j {\textbackslash}mid data)\$. I-T methods provide a basis for this inference. Null hypothesis testing merely provides a probability statement about the data conditioned on a null model, \$Prob(data {\textbackslash}mid H\_0)\$. 6. Synthesis and applications. I-T methods provide a more informative approach to inference. I-T methods provide a direct measure of evidence for or against hypotheses and a means to consider simultaneously multiple hypotheses as a basis for rigorous inference. Progress in our science can be accelerated if modern methods can be used intelligently; this includes various I-T and Bayesian methods.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}Objective: To determine whether a change in editorial policy, including the implementation of a checklist, has been associated with improved reporting of measures which might reduce the risk of bias.  Methods: The study protocol has been published at DOI: 10.1007/s11192-016-1964-8.  Design: Observational cohort study.  Population: Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted after May 1st 2013.  Intervention: Mandatory completion of a checklist at the point of manuscript revision.  Comparators: (1) Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted before May 2013; (2) Similar articles in other journals matched for date and topic.  Primary Outcome: Change in proportion of Nature publications describing in vivo research published before and after May 2013 reporting the Landis 4 items (randomisation, blinding, sample size calculation, exclusions).  We included 448 NPG papers (223 published before May 2013, 225 after) identified by an individual hired by NPG for this specific task, working to a standard procedure; and an independent investigator used Pubmed Related Citations to identify 448 non-NPG papers with a similar topic and date of publication in other journals; and then redacted all publications for time sensitive information and journal name. Redacted manuscripts were assessed by 2 trained reviewers against a 74 item checklist, with discrepancies resolved by a third.  Results: 394 NPG and 353 matching non-NPG publications described in vivo research. The number of NPG publications meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria increased from 0/203 prior to May 2013 to 31/181 (16.4\%) after (2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction, chi-squared = 36.2, df = 1, p = 1.8 x 10-9).  There was no change in the proportion of non- NPG publications meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria (1/164 before, 1/189 after). There were more substantial improvements in the individual prevalences of reporting of randomisation, blinding, exclusions and sample size calculations for in vivo experiments, and less substantial improvements for in vitro experiments.  Conclusions: There was a substantial improvement in the reporting of risks of bias in in vivo research in NPG journals following a change in editorial policy, to a level that to our knowledge has not been previously observed. However, there remain opportunities for further improvement.},

Artificial intelligence has improved the accuracy and capability of model simulations, but often at the expense of a rational understanding of the systems involved. The lack of transparency in black box models, artificial intelligence based ones among them, can potentially affect the trust in science driven policy making. Here, we suggest that a broader discussion is needed to address the implications of black box approaches on the reliability of scientific advice used for policy making. We argue that participatory methods can bridge the gap between increasingly complex scientific methods and the people affected by their interpretations},

Such practices are opening up opportunities to enhance the traditional monitoring networks, but at the same time, these sensors are producing large data sets that can become overwhelming and challenging when it comes to the scientific tools and skills required to analyze the data. To address this challenge, an open-source, robust, and cross-platform sensor data analysis toolbox called Vayu is developed that allows researchers and citizens to do detailed and reproducible analyses of air quality data. Vayu combines the power of visualization and statistical analysis using a simple and intuitive graphical user interface. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive set of tools for systematic analysis such as data conversion, interpolation, aggregation, and prediction. Even though Vayu was developed with air quality research in mind, it can be used to analyze different kinds of time-series data.},

BBN models represent site-specific KECs, habitat capability at the subwatershed level, and pattern of habitat capability across all subwatersheds. BBNs use Dirichlet prior probability distributions and standard Bayesian updating of posterior probabilities. We derived estimates of prior and conditional probabilities from a mix of empirical data and expert judgment, mostly the latter. Sensitivity analyses identified planning decisions and KECs that most influence species outcomes, and can help prioritize monitoring activities. BBN models, however, substitute for neither field studies nor empirical, quantitative population viability analyses of population demography and genetics.},

Despite the growing availability of tools of relevance for DQA in the R language, a systematic comparison of their functionalities is missing. Therefore, we review R packages related to data quality (DQ) and assess their scope against a DQ framework for observational health studies. Based on a systematic search, we screened more than 140 R packages related to DQA in the Comprehensive R Archive Network. From these, we selected packages which target at least three of the four DQ dimensions (integrity, completeness, consistency, accuracy) in a reference framework. We evaluated the resulting 27 packages for general features (e.g., usability, metadata handling, output types, descriptive statistics) and the possible assessment's breadth. To facilitate comparisons, we applied all packages to a publicly available dataset from a cohort study. We found that the packages' scope varies considerably regarding functionalities and usability. Only three packages follow a DQ concept, and some offer an extensive rule-based issue analysis. However, the reference framework does not include a few implemented functionalities, and it should be broadened accordingly. Improved use of metadata to empower DQA and user-friendliness enhancement, such as GUIs and reports that grade the severity of DQ issues, stand out as the main directions for future developments.},

  abstract = {In the current context of global change and a biodiversity crisis, there are increasing demands for greater predictive power in ecology, in both the scientific literature and at the science--policy interface. The implicit assumption is that this will increase knowledge and, in turn, lead to better decision-making. However, the justification for this assumption remains uncertain, not least because the definition of `prediction' is unclear. We propose that two types of prediction should be distinguished: corroboratory- prediction is linked to the validation of theories; and anticipatory-prediction is linked to the description of possible futures. We then discuss four families of obstacles to prediction, linked to the specific features of ecosystems: 1) they are historical entities, 2) they are complex, 3) their dynamics are stochastic, and 4) they are influenced by socio-economic drivers. A na{\"i}ve understanding of ecological science suggests that the two types of predictions are simply two phases in a sequence in which scientists first improve their knowledge of ecological systems via corroboratory-predictions, and then apply this knowledge in order to forecast future states of ecosystems via anticipatory- predictions in order to help policy makers taking decisions. This sequence is however not straightforward, partly because corroboration and anticipation are not affected by the obstacles to prediction in the same way. We thus invite to reconsider the role of ecological prediction as a tool in a deliberative model of decision-making rather than as external scientific information aimed at enlightening the political process. Doing so would be beneficial for both the policy-relevance of anticipatory-prediction and the theoretical-relevance of corroboratory-prediction.},

In the context of extracting parameters for DEB models from data, we discuss the methodology of fitting multiple models, which share parameters, to multiple data sets in a single parameter estimation. This problem is not specific to DEB models, and is (or should be) really general in biology. We discovered that a lot of estimation problems that we suffered from in the past originated from the use of a loss function that was not symmetric in the role of data and predictions. We here propose two much better symmetric candidates, that proved to work well in practice. We illustrate estimation problems and their solutions with a Monte-Carlo case study for in- creasing amount of scatter, which decreased the amount of information in the data about one or more parameter values. We here validate the method using a set of models with known parameters and different scatter struc- tures. We compare the loss functions on the basis of convergence, point and interval estimates. We also discuss the use of pseudo-data, i.e. realistic values for parameters that we treat as data from which predictions can differ. These pseudo-data are used to avoid that a good fit results in parameter values that make no biological sense. We discuss our new method for estimating confidence intervals and present a list of concrete recommendations for parameter estimation. We conclude that the proposed method performs very well in recovering parameter values of a set of models, applied to a set of data. This is consistent with our large-scale applications in practice.},

The duality of ecological restoration is acknowledged in guidance documents on the subject but is not apparent in its definition.

This viewpoint does not give appropriate credit to contributions from social sciences, nor does it provide compelling goals for people with different motivating rationales to engage in or support restoration. In this study, I give a concise history of the conceptualization and definition of ecological restoration, and I propose an alternative definition and corresponding viewpoint on restoration goal-setting to meet twenty-first century scientific and public inquiry.},

Modern frameworks for ecosystem services assessment emphasize evaluating the social benefits of ecosystems, in terms of who benefits and by how much, to aid in comparing multiple courses of action. Structured methods that use decision analytic-approaches are emerging for the practice of ecological restoration. In this article, we combine ecosystem services assessment with structured decision making to estimate and evaluate measures of the potential benefits of ecological restoration with a case study in the Woonasquatucket River watershed, Rhode Island, USA. We partnered with a local watershed management organization to analyze dozens of candidate wetland restoration sites for their abilities to supply five ecosystem services-flood water retention, scenic landscapes, learning opportunities, recreational opportunities, and birds. We developed 22 benefit indicators related to the ecosystem services as well as indicators for social equity and reliability that benefits will sustain in the future. We applied conceptual modeling and spatial analysis to estimate indicator values for each candidate restoration site. Lastly, we developed a decision support tool to score and aggregate the values for the organization to screen the restoration sites. Results show that restoration sites in urban areas can provide greater social benefits than sites in less urban areas. Our research approach is general and can be used to investigate other restoration planning studies that perform ecosystem services assessment and fit into a decision-making process.},

In this paper, we outline a model of scientific data reasoning that describes how data sensemaking underlies data reasoning. Data sensemaking, a relatively automatic process rooted in perceptual mechanisms that summarize large quantities of information in the environment, begins early in development, and is refined with experience, knowledge, and improved strategy use. Summarizing data highlights set properties such as central tendency and variability, and these properties are used to draw inferences from data. However, both data sensemaking and data reasoning are subject to cognitive biases or heuristics that can lead to flawed conclusions. The tools of scientific reasoning, including external representations, scientific hypothesis testing, and drawing probabilistic conclusions, can help reduce the likelihood of such flaws and help improve data reasoning. Although data sensemaking and data reasoning are not supplanted by scientific data reasoning, scientific reasoning skills can be leveraged to improve learning about science and reasoning with data},

In pursuit of mathematical tractability, these models use simplified descriptions of key patterns, processes and relationships observed in nature. In contrast, ecological data are often complex, scale-dependent, space-time correlated, and governed by nonlinear relations between organisms and their environment. This disparity in complexity between ecosystem models and data has created a large gap in ecology between model and data-driven approaches. Here, we explore data assimilation (DA) with the Ensemble Kalman filter to fuse a two-predator-two-prey model with abundance data from a 2600+ day experiment of a plankton community. We analyse how frequently we must assimilate measured abundances to predict accurately population dynamics, and benchmark our population model's forecast horizon against a simple null model. Results demonstrate that DA enhances the predictability and forecast horizon of complex community dynamics.},

On the one hand, conservation criteria based on areas of minimal human impact are not relevant to much of the biosphere. On the other hand, conservation criteria based on economic factors are problematic with respect to their ability to arrive at operational indicators of well-being that can be applied in practice over multiple generations. Coupled human and natural systems are subject to economic development which, under current management structures, tends to affect natural systems and cross planetary boundaries. Hence, designing and applying conservation criteria applicable in real-world systems where human and natural systems need to interact and sustainably coexist is essential. By recognizing the criticality of satisfying basic needs as well as the great uncertainty over the needs and preferences of future generations, we sought to incorporate conservation criteria based on minimal human impact into economic evaluation. These criteria require the conservation of environmental conditions such that the opportunity for intergenerational welfare optimization is maintained. Toward this end, we propose the integration of ecological-biological thresholds into decision making and use as an example the planetary-boundaries approach. Both conservation scientists and economists must be involved in defining operational ecological-biological thresholds that can be incorporated into economic thinking and reflect the objectives of conservation, sustainability, and intergenerational welfare optimization.},

  abstract = {Conservation reserves are a fundamental tool for managing biodiversity. The so-called SLOSS debate -- should we have a Single Large Or Several Small reserves -- is central to conservation theory. Population dynamic models suggest that the design that minimizes the risk of extinction of a species is case-specific, with the optimal number of reserves ranging between one and very many. Uncertainty is pervasive in ecology, but, the previous analyses of the SLOSS debate have not considered how uncertainty in the model of extinction risk might influence the optimal design. Herein, we show that when uncertainty is considered, the SLOSS problem is simplified and driven more by the aspirations of the manager than the population dynamics of the species. In this case, the optimal solution is to have in the order of twenty or fewer reserves for any species. This result shows counter-intuitively that considering uncertainty actually simplifies rather than complicates decisions about designing nature reserves.},

  abstract = {1. In conservation decision-making, we operate within the confines of limited funding. Furthermore, we often assume particular relationships between management impact and our investment in management. The structure of these relationships, however, is rarely known with certainty -- there is model uncertainty. We investigate how these two fundamentally limiting factors in conservation management, money and knowledge, impact optimal decision-making. 2. We use information-gap decision theory to find strategies for maximizing the number of extant subpopulations of a threatened species that are most immune to failure due to model uncertainty. We thus find a robust framework for exploring optimal decision-making. 3. The performance of every strategy decreases as model uncertainty increases. 4. The strategy most robust to model uncertainty depends not only on what performance is perceived to be acceptable but also on available funding and the time horizon over which extinction is considered. 5. Synthesis and applications. We investigate the impact of model uncertainty on robust decision- making in conservation and how this is affected by available conservation funding. We show that subpopulation triage can be a natural consequence of robust decision-making. We highlight the need for managers to consider triage not as merely giving up, but as a tool for ensuring species persistence in light of the urgency of most conservation requirements, uncertainty and the poor state of conservation funding. We illustrate this theory by a specific application to allocation of funding to reduce poaching impact on the Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae in Kerinci Seblat National Park.},

Ecological BBNs can be applied to complex catchment and water quality issues, integrating multiple spatial and temporal variables within social, economic and environmental decision making processes. This paper reviews the essential components required for ecologists to design a best-practice predictive BBN in an ecological risk assessment (ERA) framework for aquatic ecosystems, outlining: (1) how to create a BBN for an aquatic ERA?; (2) what are the challenges for aquatic ecologists in adopting the best-practice applications of BBNs to ERAs?; and (3) how can BBNs in ERAs influence the science/management interface into the future? The aims of this paper are achieved using three approaches. The first is to demonstrate the best-practice development of BBNs in aquatic sciences using a simple nutrient model. The second is to discuss the limitations and challenges aquatic ecologists encounter when applying BBNs to ERAs. The third is to provide a framework for integrating best-practice BBNs into ERAs and the management of aquatic ecosystems. A quantitative review of the application and development of BBNs in aquatic science from 2002 to 2014 was conducted to identify areas where continued best-practice development is required. We outline a best-practice framework for the integration of BBNs into ERAs and study of complex aquatic systems.},

  abstract = {Water resources and transportation infrastructure such as dams and culverts provide countless socio-economic benefits; however, this infra- structure can also disconnect the movement of organisms, sediment, and water through river ecosystems. Trade-offs associated with these competing costs and benefits occur globally, with applications in barrier addition (e.g. dam and road construction), reengineering (e.g. culvert repair), and removal (e.g. dam removal and aging infrastructure). Barrier prioritization provides a unique opportunity to: (i) restore and re- connect potentially large habitat patches quickly and effectively and (ii) avoid impacts prior to occurrence in line with the mitigation hierar- chy (i.e. avoid then minimize then mitigate). This paper synthesizes 46 watershed-scale barrier planning studies and presents a procedure to guide barrier prioritization associated with connectivity for aquatic organisms. We focus on practical issues informing prioritization studies such as available data sets, methods, techniques, and tools. We conclude with a discussion of emerging trends and issues in barrier prioriti- zation and key opportunities for enhancing the body of knowledge.

  abstract = {Most conservation actions are part of public policies: they are financed through taxes and are part of policy packages. Consequently, conservation practitioners often have to face challenges to the legitimacy of their ac- tions and expenses. But what is a legitimate conservation policy? This article develops a philosophically qualified answer and explores its application to concrete conservation situations. This approach is anchored in a ``per- formative'' interpretation of the philosophy of Rawls, Habermas and other deliberative democracy theorists. The performative approach emphasizes the primacy of practice and the elusiveness of purportedly definitive, purely theoretical definitions of legitimacy. As an application of this approach, a legitimate conservation policy is provisionally defined as one such that: (i) the defenders of the policy have justified it, as a matter of fact; (ii) even if it is not attacked, they are ready to argue to justify it; and (iii) if it is actually attacked, they enact this readiness. A specification of this three-fold criterion is then introduced, by analysing a series of real-life con- servation actions or policies. This analysis unveils four widespread mechanisms (opaque procedures, closed circles of experts, denials of knowledge gaps and concealments of ethical debates) leading to illegitimate con- servation policies. Identifying these mechanisms and their links with the provisional definition of legitimacy makes it possible to foster the legitimacy of conservation actions and policies. Finally, concrete practical im- plications for conservation researchers and practitioners are outlined.},

While these two fields have been closely linked in some disciplines such as medicine, comparatively little attention has been paid to the potential benefits of linking them in ecology, despite reasonable expectations that benefits would be derived from doing so. Meta-analysis combines information from multiple studies to provide more accurate parameter estimates and to reduce the uncertainty surrounding them. Decision analysis involves selecting among alternative choices using statistical information that helps to shed light on the uncertainties involved. By linking meta-analysis to decision analysis, improved decisions can be made, with quantification of the costs and benefits of alternate decisions supported by a greater density of information. Here, we briefly review concepts of both meta-analysis and decision analysis, illustrating the natural linkage between them and the benefits from explicitly linking one to the other. We discuss some examples in which this linkage has been exploited in the medical arena and how improvements in precision and reduction of structural uncertainty inherent in a meta-analysis can provide substantive improvements to decision analysis outcomes by reducing uncertainty in expected loss and maximising information from across studies. We then argue that these significant benefits could be translated to ecology, in particular to the problem of making optimal ecological decisions in the face of uncertainty.},

We derived 83 population projection matrices from 13 years of demographic data from eight populations, 59 matrices from scrub populations and 24 from firelane or yard edges. Seed dormancy and germination transitions were inferred based on experimental data and verified by comparing modeled vs. observed population trajectories. Finite rates of increase in scrub sites were highest shortly after fire and declined steeply through 10 years postfire. The break-even value of {$\lambda$} = 1 was passed quickly, in about six years, suggesting that populations \&gt;6 years postfire were already facing decline. The decline is probably related to the rapid growth of competing shrubs in the habitat of D. frutescens. In long-unburned sites, finite rates of increase were nearly always \&lt;1 and declined the most in the long-unburned site with no foot trails or treefall gaps. Finite rates of increase in firelane populations also declined with years since fire or last disking. The yard edge population showed {$\lambda$} values both \&gt;1 and \&lt;1, with no temporal trend. Stochastic simulations in scrub sites suggested an optimal regular fire return interval of about 6--12 years. Regular fires at this interval were more favorable than stochastic fire regimes, but stochasticity reduced extinction percentages at longer fire return intervals. Stochastic fire return intervals implied a wider optimal fire return interval of 6--21 years. We suggest that prescribed fire in Florida scrub on yellow sand has occurred (and needs to occur) more frequently than previously recommended.},

Three factors related to aspects of stakeholder engagement in the modelling process; the other to critical thinking around problem framing and the role(s) of models. The latter factor was considered reasonably well-achieved across the projects. Harder to control were the stakeholder engagement factors which, along with project management considerations, can constrain or enable achievement of other factors.

  abstract = {Replicability and reproducibility of computational models has been somewhat understudied by "the replication movement." In this paper, we draw on methodological studies into the replicability of psychological experiments and on the mechanistic account of explanation to analyze the functions of model replications and model reproductions in computational neuroscience. We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution. Reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.},

Publication bias further distorts success rates because the results of successful translocations may be more likely to be published than failed translocations. We conducted the first comprehensive review of all published and unpublished translocations of herpetofauna in New Zealand to assess publication bias. Of 74 translocations of 29 species in 25 years, 35 have been reported in the published literature, and the outcomes of 12 have been published. Using a traditional definition of success, publication bias resulted in a gross overestimate of translocation success rates (41.7\% and 8.1\% for published and all translocations, respectively), but bias against failed translocations was minimal (8.3\% and 6.8\%, respectively). Publication bias against translocations with uncertain outcomes, the vast majority of projects, was also strong (50.0\% and 85.1\% for published and all translocations, respectively). Recent translocations were less likely to be published than older translocations. The reasons behind translocations were related to publication. A greater percentage of translocations for conservation and research were published (63.3\% and 40.0\%, respectively) than translocations for mitigation during land development (10.0\%). Translocations conducted in collaboration with a university were more frequently published (82.7\% and 24.4\%, respectively). To account for some of this publication bias, we reassessed the outcome of each translocation using a standardized definition of success, which takes into consideration the species' life history and the time since release. Our standardized definition of translocation success provided a more accurate summary of success rates and allows for a more rigorous evaluation of the causes of translocation success and failure in large-scale reviews.},

This dilemma occurs on a grand scale in the North American Great Lakes, where dams and culverts block tributary access to habitat of desirable fish species and are a lynchpin of long-standing efforts to limit ecological damage inflicted by the invasive, parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Habitat restoration and sea-lamprey control create conflicting goals for managing aging infrastructure. We used optimization to minimize opportunity costs of habitat gains for 37 desirable migratory fishes that arose from restricting sea lamprey access (0-25\% increase) when selecting barriers for removal under a limited budget (US\$1-105 million). Imposing limits on sea lamprey habitat reduced gains in tributary access for desirable species by 15-50\% relative to an unconstrained scenario. Additional investment to offset the effect of limiting sea-lamprey access resulted in high opportunity costs for 30 of 37 species (e.g., an additional US\$20-80 million for lake sturgeon [Acipenser fulvescens]) and often required {$\geq$}5\% increase in sea-lamprey access to identify barrier-removal solutions adhering to the budget and limiting access. Narrowly distributed species exhibited the highest opportunity costs but benefited more at less cost when small increases in sea-lamprey access were allowed. Our results illustrate the value of optimization in limiting opportunity costs when balancing invasion control against restoration benefits for diverse desirable species. Such trade-off analyses are essential to the restoration of connectivity within fragmented rivers without unleashing invaders.},

Both the protracted development of working memory (WM) through adolescence, as well as individual differences in WM capacity have been theorized to be related to risk-taking behavior, including reckless driving. In a cohort study of 84 adolescent drivers Walshe et~al. (2019) found adolescents who crashed had an attenuated trajectory of WM growth compared to adolescent drivers who never reported being in a crash, but observed no difference in WM capacity at baseline. The objectives of this report were to attempt to replicate these associations and to evaluate their robustness using a hybrid multiverse - specification curve analysis approach, henceforth called multiverse representation analysis (MRA). The authors of the original report provided their data: 84 adolescent drivers with annual evaluations of WM and other risk factors from 2005 to 2013, and of driving experiences in 2015. The original analysis was implemented as described in the original report. An MRA approach was used to evaluate the robustness of the association between developmental trajectories of WM and adolescents' risk-taking (indexed by motor vehicle crash involvement) to different reasonable methodological choices. We enumerated 6 reasonable choice points in data processing-analysis configurations: (1) model type: latent growth or multi-level regression, (2) treatment of WM data; (3) which waves are included; (4) covariate treatment; (5) how time is coded; and (6) link function/estimation method: weighted least squares means and variance estimation (WLSMV) with a linear link versus logistic regression with maximum likelihood estimation. This multiverse consists of 96 latent growth models and 18 multi-level regression models.},

Since publication in 2012 the DORA principles have been signed up to by over 1500 organizations and nearly 15,000 individuals. Despite this significant progress, assessment of researchers still rarely includes considerations related to trustworthiness, rigor and transparency.  We have developed the Hong Kong Principles (HKPs) as part of the 6th World Conference on Research Integrity with a specific focus on the need to drive research improvement through ensuring that researchers are explicitly recognized and rewarded (i.e., their careers are advanced) for behavior that leads to trustworthy research. The HKP have been developed with the idea that their implementation could assist in how researchers are assessed for career advancement with a view to strengthen research integrity. We present five principles: responsible research practices; transparent reporting; open science (open research); valuing a diversity of types of research; and recognizing all contributions to research and scholarly activity. For each principle we provide a rationale for its inclusion and provide examples where these principles are already being adopted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are used to evaluate social and psychological interventions and inform policy decisions about them. Accurate, complete, and transparent reports of social and psychological intervention RCTs are essential for understanding their design, conduct, results, and the implications of the findings. However, the reporting of RCTs of social and psychological interventions remains suboptimal. The CONSORT Statement has improved the reporting of RCTs in biomedicine. A similar high-quality guideline is needed for the behavioural and social sciences. Our objective was to develop an official extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 Statement (CONSORT 2010) for reporting RCTs of social and psychological interventions: CONSORT-SPI 2018. METHODS:  We followed best practices in developing the reporting guideline extension. First, we conducted a systematic review of existing reporting guidelines. We then conducted an online Delphi process including 384 international participants. In March 2014, we held a 3-day consensus meeting of 31 experts to determine the content of a checklist specifically targeting social and psychological intervention RCTs. Experts discussed previous research and methodological issues of particular relevance to social and psychological intervention RCTs. They then voted on proposed modifications or extensions of items from CONSORT 2010. RESULTS:  The CONSORT-SPI 2018 checklist extends 9 of the 25 items from CONSORT 2010: background and objectives, trial design, participants, interventions, statistical methods, participant flow, baseline data, outcomes and estimation, and funding. In addition, participants added a new item related to stakeholder involvement, and they modified aspects of the flow diagram related to participant recruitment and retention. CONCLUSIONS:  Authors should use CONSORT-SPI 2018 to improve reporting of their social and psychological intervention RCTs. Journals should revise editorial policies and procedures to require use of reporting guidelines by authors and peer reviewers to produce manuscripts that allow readers to appraise study quality, evaluate the applicability of findings to their contexts, and replicate effective interventions.},

  abstract = {1. The resilience literature often assumes that social--ecological reorganization will result in either the removal of deficient system elements (components, interactions) or social learning. Major perturbations are expected to lead to either adaptation or, if accompanied by a regime shift, transformation. This has led to a conflation of the concepts of resilience and adapta- tion, which has in turn made it difficult to quantitatively distinguish between cases in which a system returned to a previous state, and adaptation or learning occurred, and cases in which the system was resilient but adaptation or learning did not occur. 2. We used a network analysis of nine years of ostrich movement data to explore the social-- ecological resilience of the Western Cape ostrich industry, which nearly collapsed following an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2011 and has gradually rebuilt. 3. The system that emerged following the outbreak contained fewer farms but was more connected than at any period prior to the outbreak. As system reorganization proceeded, network traits began to fluctuate seasonally and to approach values similar to those observed prior to the outbreak. It was estimated that it would take 4--5 full seasonal cycles for the system to return to a similar state to that prior to the disease outbreak. In other words, although the system reorganized following the system collapse, it remained within the same regime and showed no obvious evidence of adaptation or learning. 4. Policy implications. The majority of previous work on studying system response to disturbance has focused on outcome-based adaptation and learning. This study highlights the need to understand systems that respond to disturbance without learning or adaptation. Network analysis offers a useful quantitative tool for exploring social--ecological resilience and tracking changes in vulnerability. However, the development of better ways of incorporating additional data from multiple scales into network analysis remains an important priority for improving the predictive power and policy relevance of network approaches to analysing resilience.},

  abstract = {The effect of grassland gap size on the establishment of five non-clonal perennial forbs, comprising a range of seed masses, was investigated in two Themeda triandra Forsskal grasslands by sowing seed in 22 the centre of artificially created 6 cm (36 cm ) and 18 cm (324 cm ) wide canopy gaps. Undisturbed vegetation (0 cm gap) was used as a control. Initial seedling establishment and growth in gaps was measured over 24 weeks, as was that of transplanted juvenile plants, and all were related to light availability at ground level. The rate at which natural canopy gaps in grasslands disappear with time since burning was also quantified in a chronosequence study to infer how long gaps persist after disturbance by fire. For four of the five species, relatively few seedlings emerged ({$<$} 30\% of sown seed germinated), and emergence was largely independent of the effects of gap size, sward structure and seed mass. Only Plantago gaudichaudii Barneoud germination was inhibited under a closed sward (0 cm gap). Hence, the presence of vegetation per se largely did not affect germination for most species. Survival of seedlings, however, was negatively affected by vegetation, presumably because of low light levels in the small gaps. Eryngium ovinum Cunn., P. gaudichaudii and Velleia paradoxa R.Br. failed to establish in 0 cm gaps in the 3-year-old sward. Gaps in the vegetation, however, enabled all species to survive at low levels in at least one of the grasslands, with survival of seedlings in 18 cm gaps usually greater than that in 6 cm gaps. Survival of transplants was initially high ({$>$} 50\%) for all species in the 2-year-old sward, but E. ovinum and Senecio macrocarpus Belcher mortality was substantial in 0 cm gaps in the 3-year-old sward where light levels were lowest (i.e. {$<$} 9\% of available light). For these species, small gaps are likely to be hostile microsites for establishment at all times. Growth was also affected by gap size, most species positively responding to 18 cm gaps by growing substantially bigger than transplants in 0 cm gaps, particularly in the more shaded 3-year-old sward gaps. The large canopy 2 gaps (i.e. {$>$} 300 cm ) that enable the most effective recruitment in this grassland are rare in the years after fire and constitute only 8--19\% of all gaps that are present at 1 and 2 years after burning. By 3 years 2 --2 after fire, canopy gaps are small ({$<$} 30 cm ) and infrequent ({$<$} 3 gaps m ) as a result of rapid recovery of the dominant grass. These small gaps would appear to provide few opportunities for substantial seedling recruitment of many species by this time. If seedling recruitment events are to be optimised for the herbaceous dicotyledons that characterise this community, disturbance to the canopy is required at intervals of 1--3 years. This regime becomes particularly important when other features of the recruitment ecology of this grassland are considered.},

A number of key issues are discussed, including topics on which there are, and are not, experts who have knowledge that provides a basis for making informed predictive judgments; the inadequacy of only using qualitative uncertainty language; the role of cognitive heuristics and of overconfidence; the choice of experts; the development, refinement, and iterative testing of elicitation protocols that are designed to help experts to consider systematically all relevant knowledge when they make their judgments; the treatment of uncertainty about model functional form; diversity of expert opinion; and when it does or does not make sense to combine judgments from different experts. Although it may be tempting to view expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.},

  abstract = {Current fire management practices in the fire-prone vegetation of south-eastern Australia are based mainly on the concept of hazard reduction via the use of periodic low-intensity fires to maintain the amount of flammable fuel within specified (low) limits. We examined the possible conflict between the requirements of fire management for hazard reduction and requirements for species conservation in the dry-sclerophyll shrublands and woodlands of the Sydney region. Our data indicate that potentially severe fire hazards (fine fuel loads of {$\geq$}10 t.ha-1) can reappear in the woodland and shrubland vegetation within 2--4 years after low-intensity fires, such as are typical of the fuel-reduction burns usually prescribed. Our data also show that low-intensity fires will have significant effects on the species composition of the communities if they occur with an inter-fire interval of less than 7--8 years, causing a significantly reduced abundance of long-lived woody shrub species. There is thus a clear conflict in south-eastern Australia between fire management practices based solely on prescribed burning for hazard reduction and the fire management practices necessary to maintain ecosystem biodiversity, and this conflict is greatest for fire-sensitive shrub species. The conflict between these two vegetation management objectives cannot be resolved by a simple compromise, as prescribed fires with inter-fire intervals any greater than 4 years will allow a potentially severe fire hazard to exist, while a burning regime with any inter-fire intervals less than 8 years will result in loss of biodiversity. This conflict means that it will probably not be possible to achieve simultaneously both hazard reduction and species conservation for any specified managed area.},

We considered O'Hara and Kotze's (2010) comparisons, and determined that the finding occurred primarily because the quantity that they estimated in their simulations of the linear model analysis (the mean of a transformation of the count data) was not the same quantity that was simulated and to which the results were compared (the logarithm of the mean of the count data). We correct this discrepancy, re-run O'Hara and Kotze's simulations and add additional simple analyses. We found that the apparent superiority of the GLMs over linear models in O'Hara and Kotze's (2010) simulations was primarily an artefact of divergence in the meanings of results from the two analyses. After converting results from linear model analyses of transformed data to estimators of the same quantity as provided by the GLM, results from both analyses rarely differed substantially. Furthermore, under the circumstances considered by O'Hara and Kotze, we find that an even simpler implementation of linear model analysis, inference of the mean of the raw data, performs even better and gives identical results to the GLM. While the analysis of count data with GLMs can certainly provide many benefits, we strongly caution against interpreting O'Hara and Kotze's (2010) results as evidence that simpler approaches are severely flawed.},

  abstract = {Concerns have been growing about the veracity of psychological research. Many findings in psychological science are based on studies with insufficient statistical power and nonrepresentative samples, or may otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable settings or populations. Crowdsourced research, a type of large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects are conducted across multiple lab sites, offers a pragmatic solution to these and other current methodological challenges. The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a distributed network of laboratories designed to enable and support crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel research questions, or attempt to replicate prior research, in large, diverse samples. The PSA's mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. Here, we describe the background, structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and challenges of the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research networks, the PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time-limited), efficient (in terms of re-using structures and principles for different projects), decentralized, diverse (in terms of participants and researchers), and inclusive (of proposals, contributions, and other relevant input from anyone inside or outside of the network). The PSA and other approaches to crowdsourced psychological science will advance our understanding of mental processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and systematically examining its generalizability.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models have often been developed based on ecological data. To develop reliable data-driven models, however, a sound model training and evaluation procedures are needed. A cru- cial step in these procedures is the assessment of the model performance, with as key component the applied performance criterion. Therefore, we reviewed seven performance criteria commonly applied in presence--absence modelling (the correctly classified instances, Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, the normalised mutual information statistic, the true skill statistic and the odds ratio) and analysed their application in both the model training and evaluation process. Although estimates of predictive perfor- mance have been used widely to assess final model quality, a systematic overview was missing because most analyses of performance criteria have been empirical and only focused on specific aspects of the performance criteria. This paper provides such an overview showing that different performance criteria evaluate a model differently and that this difference may be explained by the dependency of these cri- teria on the prevalence of the validation set. We showed theoretically that these prevalence effects only occur if the data are inseparable by an n-dimensional hyperplane, n being the number of input variables. Given this inseparability, different performance criteria focus on different aspects of model performance during model training, such as sensitivity, specificity or predictive accuracy. These findings have impor- tant consequences for ecological modelling because ecological data are mostly inseparable due to data noise and the complexity of the studied system. Consequently, it should be very clear which aspect of the model performance is evaluated, and models should be evaluated consistently, that is, independent of, or taking into account, species prevalence. The practical implications of these findings are clear. They provide further insight into the evaluation of ecological presence/absence models and attempt to assist modellers in their choice of suitable performance criteria.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$} High-throughput screening generates large volumes of heterogeneous data that require a diverse set of computational tools for management, processing, and analysis. Building integrated, scalable, and robust computational workflows for such applications is challenging but highly valuable. Scientific data integration and pipelining facilitate standardized data processing, collaboration, and reuse of best practices. We describe how Jenkins-CI, an ``off-the-shelf,'' open-source, continuous integration system, is used to build pipelines for processing images and associated data from high-content screening (HCS). Jenkins-CI provides numerous plugins for standard compute tasks, and its design allows the quick integration of external scientific applications. Using Jenkins-CI, we integrated CellProfiler, an open-source image-processing platform, with various HCS utilities and a high-performance Linux cluster. The platform is web-accessible, facilitates access and sharing of high-performance compute resources, and automates previously cumbersome data and image-processing tasks. Imaging pipelines developed using the desktop CellProfiler client can be managed and shared through a centralized Jenkins-CI repository. Pipelines and managed data are annotated to facilitate collaboration and reuse. Limitations with Jenkins-CI (primarily around the user interface) were addressed through the selection of helper plugins from the Jenkins-CI community.},

We provide examples for rewriting results sections in research papers accordingly. Language of evidence has previously been suggested in medical statistics, and it is consistent with reporting approaches of international research networks, like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for example. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, ecology and evolution might benefit from adopting some of the 'good practices' that exist in other fields.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$} False positive findings are a growing problem in many research literatures. We argue that excessive false positives often stem from model uncertainty. There are many plausible ways of specifying a regression model, but researchers typically report only a few preferred estimates. This raises the concern that such research reveals only a small fraction of the possible results and may easily lead to nonrobust, false positive conclusions. It is often unclear how much the results are driven by model specification and how much the results would change if a different plausible model were used. Computational model robustness analysis addresses this challenge by estimating all possible models from a theoretically informed model space. We use large-scale random noise simulations to show (1) the problem of excess false positive errors under model uncertainty and (2) that computational robustness analysis can identify and eliminate false positives caused by model uncertainty. We also draw on a series of empirical applications to further illustrate issues of model uncertainty and estimate instability. Computational robustness analysis offers a method for relaxing modeling assumptions and improving the transparency of applied research.},

It summarizes and visualizes information content, history, and networks among a collection of documents on any given topic. Research weaving achieves this feat by combining the power of two methods: systematic mapping and bibliometrics. Systematic mapping provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge, identifying areas needing more research attention and those ready for full synthesis. Bibliometrics enables researchers to see how pieces of evidence are connected, revealing the structure and development of a field. We explain how researchers can use some or all of these tools to gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the scientific literature.},

Seemingly very different issues concerning the purity of reagents, accessibility of computational code, or misaligned incentives in academic research writ large are all collected up under this label. Prior work has attempted to address this problem by creating analytical definitions of reproducibility. We take a novel empirical, mixed methods approach to understanding variation in reproducibility discussions, using a combination of grounded theory and correspondence analysis to examine how a variety of authors narrate the story of the reproducibility crisis. Contrary to expectations, this analysis demonstrates that there is a clear thematic core to reproducibility discussions, centered on the incentive structure of science, the transparency of methods and data, and the need to reform academic publishing. However, we also identify three clusters of discussion that are distinct from the main body of articles: one focused on reagents, another on statistical methods, and a final cluster focused on the heterogeneity of the natural world. Although there are discursive differences between scientific and popular articles, we find no strong differences in how scientists and journalists write about the reproducibility crisis. Our findings demonstrate the value of using qualitative methods to identify the bounds and features of reproducibility discourse, and identify distinct vocabularies and constituencies that reformers should engage with to promote change.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-level conservation is increasingly important at global, national and local levels. Many jurisdictions have developed and apply their own protocols for assessing the threat status of ecosystems, often independently, leading to inconsistencies between and within countries which are problematic for cross- jurisdictional environmental reporting. Australia is a good example of these historic legacies, with different risk assessment methods applied nationally and in most states.The newly developed criteria for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) provide a framework to compare and contrast apparently divergent protocols. We critically reviewed the Australian protocols and compared them with the IUCN RLE, based on the following components of a risk assessment protocol: (i) categories of threat; (ii) assessment units; (iii) underlying concepts and definitions; (iv) assessment criteria; (v) uncertainty methods; and (vi) assessment outcomes. Despite some differences in specific objectives, criteria and their expression, the protocols were structurally similar, included broadly similar types of criteria, and produced assessment outcomes that were generally concordant. Alignment with the IUCN RLE would not require extensive changes to existing protocols, but would improve consistency, rigour and robustness in ecosystem risk assessment across jurisdictions. To achieve this, we recommend: (i) more quantitative assessments of functional change; (ii) separation of man- agement and policy considerations from risk assessment; and (iii) cross-referencing of assessment units in different jurisdictions. We argue that the focus on processes and ecological function, rather than only patterns, is key to robust risk assessment.},

In this article, we propose one such method that is useful in selecting explanatory variables for prediction of a binary response. Although this problem has recently been addressed using penalized likelihood methods, we adopt a Bayesian approach that utilizes a mixture of non-local prior densities and point masses on the binary regression coefficient vectors. RESULTS:  The resulting method, which we call iMOMLogit, provides improved performance in identifying true models and reducing estimation and prediction error in a number of simulation studies. More importantly, its application to several genomic datasets produces predictions that have high accuracy using far fewer explanatory variables than competing methods. We also describe a novel approach for setting prior hyperparameters by examining the total variation distance between the prior distributions on the regression parameters and the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator under the null distribution. Finally, we describe a computational algorithm that can be used to implement iMOMLogit in ultrahigh-dimensional settings ([Formula: see text]) and provide diagnostics to assess the probability that this algorithm has identified the highest posterior probability model. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:  Software to implement this method can be downloaded at: http://www.stat.tamu.edu/{$\sim$}amir/code.html CONTACT:  wwang7@mdanderson.org or vjohnson@stat.tamu.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {1. Applied ecological research is increasingly inspired by the open science movement. However, new challenges about how we define our science when biodiversity data are being shared and re-used are not solved. Among these challenges is the risk associated with blurring the distinction between research that mainly seeks to explore patterns with no a-priori articulated hypotheses (exploratory research), and research that explicitly tests a-priori formulated hypotheses (confirmatory research). 2. A rapid screening of a random selection of the peer-reviewed literature suggests that neither experimental protocols nor hypothesis-testing sensu stricto are com- mon in applied ecological research. In addition, most experiments are carried out on small spatial scales, which contrast with current global policy needs and research trends towards addressing large spatial and temporal scales. This latter trend makes it unfeasible for policy to rely mainly on insights gained from experimental research. 3. To solve fundamental local, regional and global societal challenges, we need both exploratory and confirmatory research. However, the fundamental roles that con- firmatory research testing a-priori hypothesis play in establishing causal relation- ships need to be revaluated in applied ecological research. 4. A clearer distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research is currently needed, and could be facilitated by allocating journal sections to different types of research; by embracing new tools offered by the open science era, such as pre- registration of hypothesis; by establishing new systems where post-hoc hypoth- eses emerging through exploration can also be registered for later testing; and by more broad adoption of causal inference methods that foster more structured test- ing of hypotheses about causal mechanisms from observational biodiversity data. 5. Synthesis and applications. To gain the full benefits of the open science era, re- searchers, funding bodies and journal editors should explicitly consider approaches and incentives that encourage openness about methods and approaches, as well as value the plurality of scientific approaches needed to address questions in applied ecology and conservation science.},

  abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes-a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

  abstract = {An academic scientist's professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive-getting it right-competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive-getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.},

According to common understanding, replication is repeating a study's procedure and observing whether the prior finding recurs. This definition is intuitive, easy to apply, and incorrect. We propose that replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research. This definition reduces emphasis on operational characteristics of the study and increases emphasis on the interpretation of possible outcomes. The purpose of replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence. Ironically, the value of replication may be strongest when existing understanding is weakest. Successful replication provides evidence of generalizability across the conditions that inevitably differ from the original study; Unsuccessful replication indicates that the reliability of the finding may be more constrained than recognized previously. Defining replication as a confrontation of current theoretical expectations clarifies its important, exciting, and generative role in scientific progress.},

This problem has gained a lot of attention in the field of psychology, where researchers have even started to speak of a 'replication crisis'. Fortunately, a number of measures to rectify this problem have already been proposed and implemented, some inspired by practices in other scientific fields. In this review, I briefly examine this issue in the field of psychology and suggest some practical tools and strategies that researchers can implement to increase replicability and the overall quality of their scientific research. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Researchers can implement many practical tools and strategies to improve replicability of their findings. Strategies include improving statistical inference, pre-registration, multisite collaboration, and sharing data. Different scientific fields could benefit from looking at each other's best practices.},

Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean. Because most researchers are not trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify those that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing for Registered Reports published in the psychological literature from 2014 to 2018 and attempted to independently computationally reproduce the main results in each article. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58\%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58\%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement. We provide practical recommendations based on our observations and cite examples of good research practices in the studies whose main results we reproduced.},

However, alternative sources of publication bias are questionable research practices (QRPs) that entail post hoc alterations of hypotheses to support data or post hoc alterations of data to support hypotheses. Using general strain theory as an explanatory framework, we outline the means, motives, and opportunities for researchers to better their chances of publication independent of rigor and relevance. We then assess the frequency of QRPs in management research by tracking differences between dissertations and their resulting journal publications. Our primary finding is that from dissertation to journal article, the ratio of supported to unsupported hypotheses more than doubled (0.82 to 1.00 versus 1.94 to 1.00). The rise in predictive accuracy resulted from the dropping of statistically nonsignificant hypotheses, the addition of statistically significant hypotheses, the reversing of predicted direction of hypotheses, and alterations to data. We conclude with recommendations to help mitigate the problem of an unrepresentative literature that we label the ``Chrysalis Effect.''},

  abstract = {Since the early 1990s, ecologists and evolutionary biologists have aggregated primary research using meta-analytic methods to understand ecological and evolutionary phenomena. Meta-analyses can resolve long-standing disputes, dispel spurious claims, and generate new research questions. At their worst, however, meta-analysis publications are wolves in sheep's clothing: subjective with biased conclusions, hidden under coats of objective authority. Conclusions can be rendered unreliable by inappropriate statistical methods, problems with the methods used to select primary research, or problems within the primary research itself. Because of these risks, meta-analyses are increasingly conducted as part of systematic reviews, which use structured, transparent, and reproducible methods to collate and summarise evidence. For readers to determine whether the conclusions from a systematic review or meta-analysis should be trusted - and to be able to build upon the review - authors need to report what they did, why they did it, and what they found. Complete, transparent, and reproducible reporting is measured by 'reporting quality'. To assess perceptions and standards of reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in ecology and evolutionary biology, we surveyed 208 researchers with relevant experience (as authors, reviewers, or editors), and conducted detailed evaluations of 102 systematic review and meta-analysis papers published between 2010 and 2019. Reporting quality was far below optimal and approximately normally distributed. Measured reporting quality was lower than what the community perceived, particularly for the systematic review methods required to measure trustworthiness. The minority of assessed papers that referenced a guideline ({\textasciitilde}16\%) showed substantially higher reporting quality than average, and surveyed researchers showed interest in using a reporting guideline to improve reporting quality. The leading guideline for improving reporting quality of systematic reviews is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Here we unveil an extension of PRISMA to serve the meta-analysis community in ecology and evolutionary biology: PRISMA-EcoEvo (version 1.0). PRISMA-EcoEvo is a checklist of 27 main items that, when applicable, should be reported in systematic review and meta-analysis publications summarising primary research in ecology and evolutionary biology. In this explanation and elaboration document, we provide guidance for authors, reviewers, and editors, with explanations for each item on the checklist, including supplementary examples from published papers. Authors can consult this PRISMA-EcoEvo guideline both in the planning and writing stages of a systematic review and meta-analysis, to increase reporting quality of submitted manuscripts. Reviewers and editors can use the checklist to assess reporting quality in the manuscripts they review. Overall, PRISMA-EcoEvo is a resource for the ecology and evolutionary biology community to facilitate transparent and comprehensively reported systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Background: Immunologic data, such as IgE and interleukin 4, tend to have positively skewed distributions with a long tail of larger values. This renders analyses based on normal distribution theory questionable (eg, t tests and analysis of variance) and distorts the sample mean as a measure of central tendency. These problems can be addressed through analysis of log-transformed data. Data analyzed in this fashion are summarized with the geometric mean. Objective: To elucidate the use of the logarithmic transform and the geometric mean in the analysis of immunologic data. Methods: The analysis may be conducted by transforming the data to a logarithmic scale to achieve a bell-shaped (approximately normal) distribution. The bell-shaped distribution needed to validate statistical inferences is only achieved in the transformed scale. In summarizing the research findings, the statistical analyst usually will transform means and confidence intervals from the logarithmic scale back to the original scale of measurement. Statistical inferences in the log scale remain valid for the data. The result of back transforming the mean of logarithmic values to the original scale is the geometric mean. This statistic is less subject to distortion by the unusually large values in the tail of the positively skewed distribution of the data. Results: A brief example is used to illustrate this type of analysis. Conclusions: Logarithmic transformation permits valid statistical inference for positively skewed immunologic data. A result of this analysis is the geometric mean, which is a better measure of central tendency of this data type than the usual sample mean.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$} Methodological developments and software implementations are progressing at an increasingly fast pace. The introduction and widespread acceptance of preprint archived reports and open-source software have made state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers are increasingly concerned that their results should be reproducible (i.e., the same analysis should yield the same numeric results at a later time), which is a basic requirement for assessing the results' replicability (i.e., whether results at a later time support the same conclusions). Although this age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility and replicability, it also undermines them in ways not often realized by researchers. This article draws researchers' attention to these threats and proposes guidelines to help minimize their impact. Reproducibility may be influenced by software development and change over time, a problem that is greatly compounded by the rising dependency between software packages. Replicability is affected by rapidly changing standards, researcher degrees of freedom, and possible bugs or errors in code, whether introduced by software developers or empirical researchers implementing an analysis. This article concludes with a list of recommendations to improve the reproducibility and replicability of results.},

For better or for worse, some kind of philosophy is an integral part of the doing of biology. Given this, it is more important than ever to undertake a practical assessment of what philosophy does mean and should mean to biologists. Here, I address three questions: should biologists pay any attention to 'philosophy'; should biologists pay any attention to 'philosophy of biology'; and should biologists pay any attention to the philosophy of biology literature on modelling? I describe why the last question is easily answered affirmatively, with the proviso that the practical benefits to be gained by biologists from this literature will be directly proportional to the extent to which biologists understand 'philosophy' to be a part of biology, not apart from biology.},

We therefore present a reviewers' checklist of ten questions that address these critical components. Checklists are commonly used by practitioners of other complex tasks, and we see great potential for the wider adoption of checklists for peer review, especially to reduce bias and facilitate transparency in published papers.

We present a design study where we introduced visual provenance and analytics to urban transportation planning. Maintaining the provenance of all analyses was critical to support collaborative sensemaking among the many and diverse stakeholders. Our system, STORYFACETS, exposes several different views of the same analysis session, each view designed for a specific audience: (1) the trail view provides a data flow canvas that supports in-depth exploration + provenance (expert analysts); (2) the dashboard view organizes visualizations and other content into a space-filling layout to support high-level analysis (managers); and (3) the slideshow view supports linear storytelling via interactive step-by-step presentations (laypersons). Views are linked so that when one is changed, provenance is maintained. Visual provenance is available on demand to support iterative sensemaking for any team member.},

It is indeed disappointing to discover that your data resources are not being used to their full potential. Not only have you invested your time, effort, and research grant on the project, but you may face costly redesigns if you want to improve the system later. This scenario would be less likely if the product was designed to provide users with exactly what they need, so that it is fit for purpose before its launch. We work at EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), and we consult extensively with life science researchers to find out what they need from biological data resources. We have found that although users believe that the bioinformatics community is providing accurate and valuable data, they often find the interfaces to these resources tricky to use and navigate. We believe that if you can find out what your users want even before you create the first mock-up of a system, the final product will provide a better user experience. This would encourage more people to use the resource and they would have greater access to the data, which could ultimately lead to more scientific discoveries. In this paper, we explore the need for a user-centred design (UCD) strategy when designing bioinformatics resources and illustrate this with examples from our work at EMBL-EBI. Our aim is to introduce the reader to how selected UCD techniques may be successfully applied to software design for bioinformatics.},

It puts forward the work of its author, his collaborators, and others over the past two decades as a new account of cause and effect inference that can aid practical researchers in many fields, including econometrics. Pearl adheres to several propositions on cause and effect inference. Though cause and effect relations are fundamentally deterministic (he explicitly excludes quantum mechanical phenomena from his concept of cause and effect), cause and effect analysis involves probability language. Probability language helps to convey uncertainty about cause and effect relations but is insufficient to fully express those relations. In addition to conditional probabilities of events, cause and effect analysis requires graphs or diagrams and a language that distinguishes intervention or manipulation from observation. Cause and effect analysis also requires counterfactual reasoning and causal assumptions in addition to observations and statistical assumptions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Conservation management is deploying increasingly intensive strategies to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function in response to global anthropogenic threats. These strategies include intentionally introducing and eradicating species around the world via assisted migration, rewilding, biological control, invasive species eradications, and gene drives - management actions which have become highly contentious because of their potential for unintended consequences. We conducted a global literature review of these conservation actions to quantify how often unintended outcomes occur and to elucidate their underlying causes. We found that studies reported intended outcomes in 51\% of cases, a combination of intended outcomes and unintended outcomes in 26\% of cases, and strictly unintended outcomes in 10\% of cases. Hence, unintended outcomes were reported in 36\% of all cases evaluated. In evaluating overall conservations outcomes (weighing intended vs unintended effects), some unintended effects are fairly innocuous relative to successful conservation objectives whereas others result in serious unintended consequences in recipient communities. Importantly, we also found that studies that assessed a greater number of community interactions with the target species were more likely to report unintended outcomes, suggesting that unintended consequences may be under-reported due to insufficient vetting. Most reported unintended outcomes arose from direct effects (68\%) or simple density-mediated, indirect effects (25\%) linked to the target species, with only a few documented cases arising from more complex interaction pathways (7\%). Therefore, most unintended outcomes involved simple interactions that could potentially be predicted and mitigated through more formal vetting. To address this shortfall, we applied foundational concepts from community ecology to develop a community assessment framework which can be used to systematically screen for potential impacts on nontarget species prior to implementing conservation actions. We propose that incorporating this approach to screen proposed conservation actions could help reduce unintended consequences from intentional species introductions and eradications for conservation.

It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles, and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), 2) the analysis exactly reproduces at a later point in time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible. While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility. Combining containerization, dependence management, version management, and dynamic document generation, the proposed workflow increases scientific productivity by facilitating later reproducibility and reuse of code and data.},

Consequently, many researchers believe that preregistration is only applicable in confirmatory paradigms.In practice, researchers may struggle to preregister their hypotheses because of vague theories that necessitate data-dependent decisions (aka exploration).We argue that preregistration benefits any study on the continuum between confirmatory and exploratory research.To that end, we formalize a general objective of preregistration and demonstrate that exploratory studies also benefit from preregistration.Drawing on Bayesian philosophy of science, we argue that preregistration should primarily aim to reduce uncertainty about the inferential procedure used to derive results.This approach provides a principled justification of preregistration, separating the procedure from the goal of ensuring strictly confirmatory research.We acknowledge that knowing the extent to which a study is exploratory is central, but certainty about the inferential procedure is a prerequisite for persuasive evidence.Finally, we discuss the implications of these insights for the practice of preregistration.},

There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability.

  abstract = {The popularity of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) has risen sharply in recent years. Despite this spike in popularity, the inner workings of ML and DL algorithms are often perceived as opaque, and their relationship to classical data analysis tools remains debated. Although it is often assumed that ML and DL excel primarily at making predictions, ML and DL can also be used for analytical tasks traditionally addressed with statistical models. Moreover, most recent discussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, failing to synthesise the wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL, starting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm families, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML principles. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction tasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical methods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for ecological problems. Finally, we summarize emerging trends such as scientific and causal ML, explainable AI, and responsible AI that may significantly impact ecological data analysis in the future. We conclude that ML and DL are powerful new tools for predictive modelling and data analysis. The superior performance of ML and DL algorithms compared to statistical models can be explained by their higher flexibility and automatic data-dependent complexity optimization. However, their use for causal inference is still disputed as the focus of ML and DL methods on predictions creates challenges for the interpretation of these models. Nevertheless, we expect ML and DL to become an indispensable tool in ecology and evolution, comparable to other traditional statistical tools.},

The emergent field of 'multilayer networks' provides a natural framework for extending analyses of ecological systems to include such multiple layers of complexity, as it specifically allows one to differentiate and model 'intralayer' and 'interlayer' connectivity. The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous, related approaches; illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data; and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer network theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to investigate ecological complexity and provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems.},

  abstract = {Background. Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the ``citation benefit''. Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9\% (95\% confidence interval: 5\% to 13\%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30\%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20\% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.},

Here, we illustrate the mathematical links between SDMs and JSDMs and their ecological implications and demonstrate that JSDMs, just like SDMs, cannot separate environmental effects from biotic interactions. We provide a guide to the conditions under which JSDMs are (or are not) preferable to SDMs for species community modeling.

It is therefore paramount to consider the validity of these results. A well-documented threat to the validity of research synthesis results is the presence of publication bias, a phenomenon where studies with large and/or statistically significant effects, relative to studies with small or null effects, are more likely to be published. We investigated this phenomenon empirically by reviewing meta-analyses published in top-tier journals between 1986 and 2013 that quantified the difference between effect sizes from published and unpublished research. We reviewed 383 meta-analyses of which 81 had sufficient information to calculate an effect size. Results indicated that published studies yielded larger effect sizes than those from unpublished studies ([Formula: see text] = 0.18, 95\% confidence interval [0.10, 0.25]). Moderator analyses revealed that the difference was larger in meta-analyses that included a wide range of unpublished literature. We conclude that intervention researchers require continued support to publish null findings and that meta-analyses should include unpublished studies to mitigate the potential bias from publication status.},

In these lecture notes, the usual workflow of the use of mathematical models to investigate a biological problem is described and the use of a collection of model is motivated. Models depend on parameters that must be estimated using observations; and when a collection of models is considered, the best model has then to be identified based on available observations. Hence, model calibration and selection, which are intrinsically linked, are essential steps of the workflow. Here, some procedures for model calibration and a criterion, the Akaike Information Criterion, of model selection based on experimental data are described. Rough derivation, practical technique of computation and use of this criterion are detailed.},

With these powerful techniques comes the danger of {$<$}jats:italic{$>$}overfitting of hyper-parameters{$<$}/jats:italic{$>$} which can render results invalid, and cause a failure to generalize beyond the data set. We refer to this problem as {$<$}jats:italic{$>$}`over-hyping'{$<$}/jats:italic{$>$} and show that it is pernicious despite commonly used precautions. In particular, over-hyping occurs when an analysis is run repeatedly with slightly different analysis parameters and one set of results is selected based on the analysis. When this is done, the resulting method is unlikely to generalize to a new dataset, rendering it a partially, or perhaps even completely spurious result that will not be valid outside of the data used in the original analysis. While it is commonly assumed that cross-validation is an effective protection against such spurious results generated through overfitting or overhyping, this is not actually true. In this article, we show that both one-shot and iterative optimization of an analysis are prone to over-hyping, despite the use of cross-validation. We demonstrate that non-generalizable results can be obtained even on non-informative (i.e. random) data by modifying hyper-parameters in seemingly innocuous ways. We recommend a number of techniques for limiting over-hyping, such as lock-boxes, blind analyses, pre-registrations, and nested cross-validation. These techniques, are common in other fields that use machine learning, including computer science and physics. Adopting similar safeguards is critical for ensuring the robustness of machine-learning techniques in the neurosciences.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility is a key tenet of the scientific process that dictates the reliability and generality of results and methods. The complexities of ecological observations and data present novel challenges in satisfying needs for reproducibility, and also transparency. Ecological systems are dynamic and heterogeneous, interacting with numerous factors that sculpt natural history and that investigators cannot completely control. Observations may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal context, making them very difficult to reproduce, but computational reproducibility still can be achieved. Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software as the original study. When coded workflows are shared, authors and editors provide transparency for readers and allow other researchers to build directly and efficiently on primary work. These qualities may be especially important in ecological applications that have important or controversial implications for science, management, and policy. Expectations for computational reproducibility and transparency are shifting rapidly in the sciences. In this work we highlight many of the unique challenges for ecology along with practical guidelines for reproducibility and transparency, as ecologists continue to participate in the stewardship of critical environmental information and ensure that research methods demonstrate integrity.},

The goal of the Task Force was to provide the psychological community with a consensus template for the preregistration of quantitative research in psychology, one with wide coverage and the ability, if necessary, to adapt to specific journals, disciplines and researcher needs. This article covers the structure and use of the PRP-QUANT template, while outlining and discussing the benefits of its use for researchers, authors, funders and other relevant stakeholders. We hope that by introducing this template and by demonstrating the support of preregistration by major academic psychological societies, we will facilitate an increase in preregistration practices and thereby also the further advancement of transparency and knowledge-sharing in the psychological sciences.},

At the core of this problem is the use of conservation measures (inputs, outputs, and outcomes) that do not explicitly address conservation impact, and thus risk undermining its achievement. These measures are used to formulate policy targets and operational objectives, gauge progress towards them, and identify priorities for action. In particular, the pervasive use of representation of biodiversity features as a sole basis for identifying priorities, and the considerable global effort directed towards increasing protected-area extent and assessing protected-area management effectiveness, exemplify that much conservation decision-making is founded more on belief systems than evidence. Measures such as the extent or representativeness of protected areas risk mis- directing conservation actions towards areas of low impact and misleading decision-makers and the public about conservation progress. To promote more effective, evidence-informed decision-making, analytical evidence can and should be used to test and refine decision-makers' implicit models of the world, focusing on predicting conservation impact - the future difference made by our future actions - to increase our effectiveness and accountability.},

In response to this, and as part of a broader open science movement, a variety of changes to research practice have started to be implemented, such as publicly sharing data, analysis code, and study materials, as well as the preregistration of research questions, study designs, and analysis plans. This chapter outlines the relevance and applicability of these issues to computational modelling, highlighting the importance of good research practices for modelling endeavours, as well as the potential of provenance modelling standards, such as PROV, to help discover and minimise the extent to which modelling is impacted by unreliable research findings from other disciplines.},

Despite potential drawbacks, HARK has deepened thinking about complex causal processes. Some of the HARK precautions can conflict with the modern reality of researchers' obligations to use big, `organic' data sources---from high-throughput genomics to social media streams. We here propose a HARK-solid, reproducible inference framework suitable for big data, based on models that represent formalization of hypotheses. Reproducibility is attained by employing two levels of model validation: internal (relative to data collated around hypotheses) and external (independent to the hypotheses used to generate data or to the data used to generate hypotheses). With a model-centered paradigm, the reproducibility focus changes from the ability of others to reproduce both data and specific inferences from a study to the ability to evaluate models as representation of reality. Validation underpins `natural selection' in a knowledge base maintained by the scientific community. The community itself is thereby supported to be more productive in generating and critically evaluating theories that integrate wider, complex systems.},

This paper reports an investigation by four coordinated laboratories of the prospective replicability of 16 novel experimental findings using rigour-enhancing practices: confirmatory tests, large sample sizes, preregistration and methodological transparency. In contrast to past systematic replication efforts that reported replication rates averaging 50\%, replication attempts here produced the expected effects with significance testing (               P               \,{$<$}\,0.05) in 86\% of attempts, slightly exceeding the maximum expected replicability based on observed effect sizes and sample sizes. When one lab attempted to replicate an effect discovered by another lab, the effect size in the replications was 97\% that in the original study. This high replication rate justifies confidence in rigour-enhancing methods to increase the replicability of new discoveries.},

However, many important ecological studies concern single, non-replicated events in which the P value has no clear interpretation. For the non-replicated study, Bayesian statistical inference provides an attractive alternative to classical statistical inference, as the results from a Bayesian analysis either may assume a long-run frequency interpretation or may be expressed as a probability of a unique event. An example concerning trends in lake acidification is used to show that the Bayesian approach is more compatible with scientific needs and scientific judgment than is classical hypothesis testing.},

The paper is based on an empirical analysis of interviews with 32 researchers and stakeholders across 13 environmental management research projects, each of which included elements of knowledge co-creation and sharing in their design. The projects focused on a range of upland and catchment management issues across the UK, and included Research Council, Government and NGO funded projects. Preliminary findings were discussed with knowledge exchange professionals and academic experts to ensure the emerging principles were as broadly applicable as possible across multiple disciplines. The principles suggest that: knowledge exchange needs to be designed into research; the needs of likely research users and other stakeholders should be systematically represented in the research where possible; and long-term relationships must be built on trust and two-way dialogue between researchers and stakeholders in order to ensure effective co-generation of new knowledge. We found that the delivery of tangible benefits early on in the research process helps to ensure continued motivation and engagement of likely research users. Knowledge exchange is a flexible process that must be monitored, reflected on and continuously refined, and where possible, steps should be taken to ensure a legacy of ongoing knowledge exchange beyond initial research funding. The principles have been used to inform the design of knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement guidelines for two international research programmes. They are able to assist researchers, decision-makers and other stakeholders working in contrasting environmental management settings to work together to co-produce new knowledge, and more effectively share and apply existing knowledge to manage environmental change.},

  abstract = {As the number and intensity of threats to biodiversity increase, there is a critical need to investigate interactions between threats and manage populations accordingly. We ask whether it is possible to reduce the effects of one threat by mitigating another. We used long-term data for the long-lived resprouter, Xanthorrhoea resinosa Pers., to parameterise an individual-based population model. This plant is currently threatened by adverse fire regimes and the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. We tested a range of fire and disease scenarios over various time horizons relevant to the population dynamics of the species and the practicalities of management. While fire does not kill the disease, it does trigger plant demographic responses that may promote population persistence when disease is present. Population decline is reduced with frequent fires because they promote the greatest number of germination events, but frequent fires reduce adult stages, which is detrimental in the long term. Fire suppression is the best action for the non-seedling stages but does not promote recruitment. With disease, frequent fire produced the highest total population sizes for shorter durations, but for longer durations fire suppression gave the highest population sizes. When seedlings were excluded, fire suppression was the best action. We conclude that fire management can play an important role in mitigating threats posed by this disease. The best approach to reducing declines may be to manage populations across a spatial mosaic in which the sequence of frequent fires and suppression are staggered across patches depending on the level of disease at the site.},

Recent advances in uncertainty quantification methods, such as polynomial chaos approaches, allow for the analysis of models with random parameters. We introduce these methods with a motivating case study of sea ice algal blooms in heterogeneous environments. We compare Monte Carlo methods with polynomial chaos techniques to help understand the dynamics of an algal bloom model with random parameters. Modelling key parameters in the algal bloom model as random variables changes the timing, intensity and overall productivity of the modelled bloom. The computational efficiency of polynomial chaos methods provides a promising avenue for the broader inclusion of parametric uncertainty in ecological models, leading to improved model predictions and synthesis between models and data.},

In particular, we discuss data integration and how the limited availability of large-scale data sets can hinder new discoveries. Finally, we propose solutions to increase the rate of data preservation, for example by generating mechanisms insuring proper data management and archiving, by providing training in data management, and by transforming the traditional role of research institutions and libraries as data generators toward managers and archivers.},

The robustness of published study results can be assessed using the relatively new multiverse-analysis methodology, in which the robustness of the effect estimates against data analytical decisions is assessed. However, the uptake of multiverse analysis in empirical studies remains low, which might be due to the scarcity of guidance available on performing multiverse analysis. Researchers might experience difficulties in identifying data analytical decisions and in summarizing the large number of effect estimates yielded by a multiverse analysis. These difficulties are amplified when applying multiverse analysis to assess the robustness of the effect estimates from a mediation analysis, as a mediation analysis involves more data analytical decisions than a bivariate analysis. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview and worked example of the use of multiverse analysis to assess the robustness of the effect estimates from a mediation analysis. We showed that the number of data analytical decisions in a mediation analysis is larger than in a bivariate analysis. By using a real-life data example from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, we demonstrated the application of multiverse analysis to a mediation analysis. This included the use of specification curves to determine the impact of data analytical decisions on the magnitude and statistical significance of the direct, indirect, and total effect estimates. Although the multiverse analysis methodology is still relatively new and future research is needed to further advance this methodology, this paper shows that multiverse analysis is a useful method for the assessment of the robustness of the direct, indirect, and total effect estimates in a mediation analysis and thereby to inform replication studies.},

The checklist is applied here to an energy model for the problem of assessing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Use of the checklist suggests that results on this issue are contingent on a number of assumptions that are highly value-laden. When these assumptions are held fixed, the model is deemed capable of producing moderately robust results of relevance to climate policy over the longer term. Checklist responses also indicate that a number of details critical to policy choices or outcomes on this issue are not captured in the model, and model results should therefore be supplemented with alternative analyses.},

  abstract = {The field of biodiversity conservation has recently been criticized as relying on a fixist view of the living world in which existing species constitute at the same time targets of conservation efforts and static states of reference, which is in apparent disagreement with evolutionary dynamics. We reviewed the prominent role of species as conservation units and the common benchmark approach to conservation that aims to use past biodiversity as a reference to conserve current biodiversity. We found that the species approach is justified by the discrepancy between the time scales of macroevolution and human influence and that biodiversity benchmarks are based on reference processes rather than fixed reference states. Overall, we argue that the ethical and theoretical frameworks underlying conservation research are based on macroevolutionary processes, such as extinction dynamics. Current species, phylogenetic, community, and functional conservation approaches constitute short-term responses to short-term human effects on these reference processes, and these approaches are consistent with evolutionary principles.},

  abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

  abstract = {In restoration science, evidence reviews play a crucial role in summarizing research findings in practice and policy. However, if unreliable or inappropriate methods are used to review evidence, decisions based on these reviews may not accurately reflect the available evidence base. To assess the current value of restoration reviews, we examined a sample of meta-analyses and narrative syntheses (n = 91) with the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Synthesis Assessment Tool (CEESAT), which uses detailed criteria to assesses the method of policy-relevant evidence synthesis according to elements important for objectivity, transparency, and comprehensiveness. Overall, reviews scored low based on this standard: median score 16 out of 39, modal score 15, and mean 16.6. Meta-analyses scored higher than narrative syntheses (median 17 vs. 5, respectively), although there were some outlier narrative syntheses that had high scores, suggesting that quantitative synthesis does not solely reflect the reliability of a review. In general, criteria spanning the more fundamental review stages (i.e., searching for studies and including studies) received low scores for both synthesis types. Conversely, criteria comprising the later stages of the review (i.e., critical appraisal, data extraction, and data synthesis) were generally well described in meta-analyses; thus, these criteria achieved the highest individual CEESAT scores. We argue that restoration ecology is well positioned to advance so-called evidence-based restoration, but review authors should elucidate their conceptual understanding of evidence syntheses and recognize that conducting reliable reviews demands the same methodological rigor and reporting standards used in primary research. Given the potential of evidence reviews to inform management, policy, and research, it is of vital importance that the overall methodological reliability of restoration reviews be improved. {\copyright} 2020 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Well-developed tools exist for prioritizing areas for one-off and binary actions (e.g. protect versus not-protect), but methods for prioritizing incremental or ongoing actions (such as habitat creation and maintenance) remain uncommon. We present an approach that combines metapopulation viability and cost-effectiveness analyses to select among alternative conservation actions, while accounting for uncertainty. In our study, 'cost-effectiveness' is the ratio between the benefit of an action and its economic cost, where benefit is the change in metapopulation viability. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of the endangered growling grass frog, Litoria raniformis, which is threatened by urban development. We extended a Bayesian model to predict metapopulation viability under nine urbanization and management scenarios, and incorporated the full probability distribution of possible outcomes for each scenario into the cost-effectiveness analysis. This allowed us to discern between cost-effective alternatives that were robust to uncertainty and those with a relatively high risk of failure. Our analyses suggest that creation and maintenance of wetlands dedicated to L.~raniformis is the only cost-effective action likely to result in a sufficiently low risk of extinction. To our knowledge this is the first study to use Bayesian metapopulation viability analysis to explicitly incorporate parametric and demographic uncertainty into a cost-effective evaluation of conservation actions. The approach offers guidance to decision-makers aiming to achieve cost-effective conservation under uncertainty. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

By making our subjective elements focal, we provide an avenue for common sense and expertise to enter the analysis. We cover the role of models in linking theory to data, the notion that models are abstractions which are neither true nor false, the need for relative model comparison, the role of predictions in stating relative evidence for models, and the role of subjectivity in specifying models that yield predictions. In the end, we conclude that transparent subjectivity leads to a more honest and fruitful analyses in psychological science.},

  abstract = {Ongoing ecosystem degradation and transformation are major threats to biodiversity. Measuring ecosystem change toward collapse relies on monitoring indicators that quantify key ecological processes. Yet little guidance is available on selection and use of indicators for ecosystem risk assessment. We reviewed indicator use in ecological studies of ecosystem collapse in marine pelagic and temperate forest ecosystems. We examined indicator-selection methods, indicator types (geographic distribution, abiotic, biotic), methods of assessing multiple indicators, and temporal quality of time series. We compared how these factors were applied in the ecological studies with how they were applied in risk assessments by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Ecosystems (RLE), for which indicators are used to estimate risk of ecosystem collapse. Ecological studies and RLE assessments rarely reported how indicators were selected, particularly in terrestrial ecosystems. Few ecological studies and RLE assessments quantified ecosystem change based on all 3 indicator types, and indicators types used differed between marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Several studies used indices or multivariate analyses to assess multiple indicators simultaneously, but RLE assessments did not because as RLE guidelines advise against them. Most studies and RLE assessments used time-series data that spanned at least 30 years, which increases the probability of reliably detecting change. Limited use of indicator-selection protocols and infrequent use of all 3 indicator types may hamper accurate detection of change. To improve the value of risk assessments for informing policy and management, we recommend using explicit protocols, including conceptual models, to identify and select indicators; a range of indicators spanning distributional, abiotic, and biotic features; indices and multivariate analyses with extreme care until guidelines are developed; time series with sufficient data to increase ability to accurately diagnose directional change; data from multiple sources to support assessments; and explicitly reporting steps in the assessment process.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity indicators are used to inform decisions and measure progress towards global targets, such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Indicators aggregate and simplify complex information, so underlying information influencing its reliability and interpretation (e.g., variability in data and uncertainty in indicator values) can be lost. Communicating uncertainty is necessary to ensure robust decisions and limit misinterpretations of trends, yet variability and uncertainty are rarely quantified in biodiversity indicators. Here, we provide a guide to representing uncertainty and variability in biodiversity indicators. We describe the key purposes of biodiversity indicators and outline commonly used methods for representing uncertainty (standard error, bootstrap resampling, jackknife resampling) and variability (quantiles, standard deviation, median absolute deviation, mean absolute deviation) with intervals. Using three high-profile biodiversity indicators (Red List Index, Living Planet Index, Ocean Health Index), we demonstrate the use, suitability and interpretation of each interval method depending on the formulation and data types underpinning the indicators. We find that the methods can reveal vastly different information, with indicator formula and data distribution affecting the suitability of each interval method. As the data underpinning each indicator were not normally distributed, methods relying on normality or symmetrical spread were unsuitable. Quantiles, bootstrapping and jackknifing provided useful information about the underlying variability and uncertainty. We present a decision tree to support selection of appropriate interval method representing uncertainty or variation in biodiversity indicators, depending on data type and objectives. Our guide aims to support transparent and effective communication of biodiversity indicator trends to facilitate accurate interpretation by decision makers. Article Impact Statement: Communication of variability and uncertainty in biodiversity indicators is key for accurate interpretation of biodiversity trends to support decision making.

However, despite remarkable progress in the identification and characterization of novel mechanisms of the oncogenic process, the success rate for approval of oncology drugs remains low relative to other therapeutic areas. Innovative preclinical and clinical approaches, such as the use of advanced genomic technologies, as well as branched adaptive clinical trial designs, have the potential to accelerate the development and approval of highly effective oncology drugs, along with a matching diagnostic test to identify those patients most likely to benefit from the new treatment. To maximize the effectiveness of these new strategies, close collaboration between academic, industry, and regulatory agencies will be required. In this Review, we highlight new approaches in preclinical and clinical drug development that will help accelerate approval of drugs, and aim to provide more-effective treatments alongside companion diagnostic tests to ensure the right treatment is given to the right patient.},

While investigations of the diversity of evolutionary stable states (ESSs) are widespread, the diversity of communities that have yet to reach an evolutionary endpoint is poorly understood. We use Lotka--\-Volterra dynamics and trait-\-based competition to compare the diversity of randomly assembled communities to the diversity of the ESS. We show that, with a large enough founding diversity (whether assembled at once or through sequential invasions), the number of long-\-time surviving species exceeds that of the ESS. However, the excessive founding diversity required to assemble a saturated community increases rapidly with the dimension of phenotype space. Additionally, traits present in communities resulting from random assembly are more clustered in phenotype space compared to random, although still markedly less ordered than the ESS. By combining theories of random assembly and ESSs we bring a new viewpoint to both the saturation and random assembly literature.},

We demonstrate the behaviors of three techniques (conditional inference tree, model-based tree, and permutation-based random forest) by analyzing an artificially generated example dataset that contains patterns based on nonlinearity and variable interactions. The results show the potential of statistically reinforced machine learning algorithms to detect nonlinear relationships and higher-order interactions. Estimation reliability for any technique, however, depended on sample size. The applications of statistically reinforced machine learning approaches would be particularly beneficial for investigating (1) novel patterns for which shapes cannot be assumed a priori, (2) higher-order interactions which are often overlooked in parametric statistics, (3) context dependency where patterns change depending on other conditions, (4) significance and effect sizes of variables while taking nonlinearity and variable interactions into account, and (5) a hypothesis using parametric statistics after identifying patterns using statistically reinforced machine learning techniques.},

  abstract = {In psychology, preregistration is the most widely used method to ensure the confirmatory status of analyses. However, the method has disadvantages: Not only is it perceived as effortful and time-consuming, but reasonable deviations from the analysis plan demote the status of the study to exploratory. An alternative to preregistration is analysis blinding, in which researchers develop their analysis on an altered version of the data. In this experimental study, we compare the reported efficiency and convenience of the two methods in the context of the Many-Analysts Religion Project. In this project, 120 teams answered the same research questions on the same data set, either preregistering their analysis (n = 61) or using analysis blinding (n = 59). Our results provide strong evidence (Bayes factor [BF] = 71.40) for the hypothesis that analysis blinding leads to fewer deviations from the analysis plan, and if teams deviated, they did so on fewer aspects. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found strong evidence (BF = 13.19) that both methods required approximately the same amount of time. Finally, we found no and moderate evidence on whether analysis blinding was perceived as less effortful and frustrating, respectively. We conclude that analysis blinding does not mean less work, but researchers can still benefit from the method because they can plan more appropriate analyses from which they deviate less frequently.},

For the past decade, psychological scientists have been increasingly concerned about the degree of such distortion in their literature. A new publication format has been developed to prevent selective reporting: In Registered Reports (RRs), peer review and the decision to publish take place before results are known. We compared the results in published RRs ( N = 71 as of November 2018) with a random sample of hypothesis-testing studies from the standard literature ( N = 152) in psychology. Analyzing the first hypothesis of each article, we found 96\% positive results in standard reports but only 44\% positive results in RRs. We discuss possible explanations for this large difference and suggest that a plausible factor is the reduction of publication bias and/or Type I error inflation in the RR literature.},

Planning and decision sup- port frameworks are designed to help conservation practitioners increase plan- ning rigor, project accountability, stakeholder participation, transparency in decisions, and learning. We describe and contrast five common frameworks within the context of six fundamental questions (why, who, what, where, when, how) at each of three planning stages of adaptive management (project scoping, operational planning, learning). We demonstrate that decision sup- port frameworks provide varied and extensive tools for conservation planning and management. However, using any framework in isolation risks dimin- ishing potential benefits since no one framework covers the full spectrum of potential conservation planning and decision challenges. We describe two case studies that have effectively deployed tools from across conservation frame- works to improve conservation actions and outcomes. Attention to the critical questions for conservation project planning should allow practitioners to op- erate within any framework and adapt tools to suit their specific management context. We call on conservation researchers and practitioners to regularly use decision support search.},

This is also the case in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Often, this is the case due to unpublished data and/or source-code, and due to sensitivity to ML training conditions. Although different solutions to address this issue are discussed in the research community such as using ML platforms, the level of reproducibility in MLdriven research is not increasing substantially. Therefore, in this mini survey, we review the literature on reproducibility in ML-driven research with three main aims: (i) reflect on the current situation of ML reproducibility in various research fields, (ii) identify reproducibility issues and barriers that exist in these research fields applying ML, and (iii) identify potential drivers such as tools, practices, and interventions that support ML reproducibility. With this, we hope to contribute to decisions on the viability of different solutions for supporting ML reproducibility.},

Together with estimating overall effect magnitudes, meta-analyses estimate differences between effect sizes via heterogeneity statistics. It is widely hypothesized that heterogeneity will be present in ecological/evolutionary meta-analyses due to the system-specific nature of biological phenomena. Despite driving recommended best practices, the generality of heterogeneity in ecological data has never been systematically reviewed. We reviewed 700 studies, finding 325 that used formal meta-analysis, of which total heterogeneity was reported in fewer than 40\%. We used second-order meta-analysis to collate heterogeneity statistics from 86 studies. Our analysis revealed that the median and mean heterogeneity, expressed as I(2) , are 84.67\% and 91.69\%, respectively. These estimates are well above "high" heterogeneity (i.e., 75\%), based on widely adopted benchmarks. We encourage reporting heterogeneity in the forms of I(2) and the estimated variance components (e.g., {$\tau$}(2) ) as standard practice. These statistics provide vital insights in to the degree to which effect sizes vary, and provide the statistical support for the exploration of predictors of effect-size magnitude. Along with standard meta-regression techniques that fit moderator variables, multi-level models now allow partitioning of heterogeneity among correlated (e.g., phylogenetic) structures that exist within data.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis is often used to make generalizations across all available evidence at the global scale. But how can these global generalizations be used for evidence-based decision making at the local scale, if only the local evidence is perceived to be relevant to a local decision? We show how an interactive method of meta-analysis --- dynamic meta-analysis --- can be used to assess the local relevance of global evidence. We developed Metadataset (www.metadataset.com) as an example of dynamic meta-analysis. Using Metadataset, we show how evidence can be filtered and weighted, and results can be recalculated, using dynamic methods of subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and recalibration. With an example from agroecology, we show how dynamic meta-analysis could lead to different conclusions for different subsets of the global evidence. Dynamic meta-analysis could also lead to a rebalancing of power and responsibility in evidence synthesis, since evidence users would be able to make decisions that are typically made by systematic reviewers --- decisions about which studies to include (e.g., critical appraisal) and how to handle missing or poorly reported data (e.g., sensitivity analysis). We suggest that dynamic meta-analysis could be scaled up and used for subject-wide evidence synthesis in several scientific disciplines (e.g., agroecology and conservation biology). However, the metadata that are used to filter and weight the evidence would need to be standardized within disciplines.},

  abstract = {Biological systems, at all scales of organisation from nucleic acids to ecosystems, are inherently complex and variable. Biologists therefore use statistical analyses to detect signal among this systemic noise. Statistical models infer trends, find functional relationships and detect differences that exist among groups or are caused by experimental manipulations. They also use statistical relationships to help predict uncertain futures. All branches of the biological sciences now embrace the possibilities of mixed-effects modelling and its flexible toolkit for partitioning noise and signal. The mixed-effects model is not, however, a panacea for poor experimental design, and should be used with caution when inferring or deducing the importance of both fixed and random effects. Here we describe a selection of the perils and pitfalls that are widespread in the biological literature, but can be avoided by careful reflection, modelling and model-checking. We focus on situations where incautious modelling risks exposure to these pitfalls and the drawing of incorrect conclusions. Our stance is that statements of significance, information content or credibility all have their place in biological research, as long as these statements are cautious and well-informed by checks on the validity of assumptions. Our intention is to reveal potential perils and pitfalls in mixed model estimation so that researchers can use these powerful approaches with greater awareness and confidence. Our examples are ecological, but translate easily to all branches of biology.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves-containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values--only right-skewed p--curves are diagnostic of evidential value.

We illustrate the use of this technique by applying it to three findings from two different papers, one investigating discrimination based on distinctively Black names, the other investigating the effect of assigning female versus male names to hurricanes.

Our novel metrics, based on custom filters of content hashes of container contents, allow for comparison of an entire container, including operating system, custom software, and metadata. First we will review Singularity Hub's primary use cases and how the infrastructure has been designed to support modern, common workflows. Next, we conduct three analyses to demonstrate build consistency, reproducibility metric and performance and interpretability, and potential for discovery. This is the first effort to demonstrate a rigorous assessment of measurable similarity between containers and operating systems. We provide these capabilities within Singularity Hub, as well as the source software singularity-python that provides the underlying functionality.

  abstract = {When making predictions about ecosystems, we often have available a number of different ecosystem models that attempt to represent their dynamics in a detailed mechanistic way. Each of these can be used as simulators of large-scale experiments and make forecasts about the fate of ecosystems under different scenarios in order to support the development of appropriate management strategies. However, structural differences, systematic discrepancies and uncertainties lead to different models giving different predictions under these scenarios. This is further complicated by the fact that the models may not be run with the same species or functional groups, spatial structure or time scale. Rather than simply trying to select a 'best' model, or taking some weighted average, it is important to exploit the strengths of each of the available models, while learning from the differences between them. To achieve this, we construct a flexible statistical model of the relationships between a collection or 'ensemble' of mechanistic models and their biases, allowing for structural and parameter uncertainty and for different ways of representing reality. Using this statistical meta-model, we can combine prior beliefs, model estimates and direct observations using Bayesian methods, and make coherent predictions of future outcomes under different scenarios with robust measures of uncertainty. In this paper we present the modelling framework and discuss results obtained using a diverse ensemble of models in scenarios involving future changes in fishing levels. These examples illustrate the value of our approach in predicting outcomes for possible strategies pertaining to climate and fisheries policy aimed at improving food security and maintaining ecosystem integrity.},

  abstract = {Despite discussions about the replicability of findings in psychological research, two issues have been largely ignored: selection mechanisms and model assumptions. Both topics address the same fundamental question: Does the chosen statistical analysis tool adequately model the data generation process? In this article, we address both issues and show, in a first step, that in the face of selective samples and contrary to common practice, the validity of inferences, even when based on experimental designs, can be claimed without further justification and adaptation of standard methods only in very specific situations. We then broaden our perspective to discuss consequences of violated assumptions in linear models in the context of psychological research in general and in generalized linear mixed models as used in item response theory. These types of misspecification are oftentimes ignored in the psychological research literature. It is emphasized that the above problems cannot be overcome by strategies such as preregistration, large samples, replications, or a ban on testing null hypotheses. To avoid biased conclusions, we briefly discuss tools such as model diagnostics, statistical methods to compensate for selectivity and semi- or non-parametric estimation. At a more fundamental level, however, a twofold strategy seems indispensable: (1) iterative, cumulative theory development based on statistical methods with theoretically justified assumptions, and (2) empirical research on variables that affect (self-) selection into the observed part of the sample and the use of this information to compensate for selectivity.},

  doi = {10.31234/osf.io/bwr48},
  abstract = {Researchers are increasingly paying attention to practices that can capitalize on chance. Capitalizing on chance can lead to unreplicable results in the form of false-positive tests, biased estimates, or overfit models. Preregistration of analysis plans, where a researcher anticipates all analysis decisions in advance and makes a plan for each one, has been promoted as one way to make inferences more sound and findings more replicable. Preregistration works by creating decision independence: analytic decisions are the same regardless of the potentially spurious features of the specific dataset being analyzed, instead of being overfit to them. But preregistration can be difficult in practice for some complicated research paradigms, including longitudinal studies, statistical modeling, machine learning, and other large multivariate designs and analyses where key decisions may be difficult to anticipate or make in advance. When simple preregistration is not practical, other strategies that create decision independence can be incorporated into it or used in place of it. This manuscript describes six such strategies: standardization, blind analysis, data partitioning, supporting studies, coordinated analysis, and multiverse analysis. All of them can be used to create adaptive preregistrations, and several can also be used when decisions arise that were not anticipated. Used together, they can form an integrative, multi-strategy approach to drawing sound inferences in a wide range of research.},

We developed a survey tool to assess the availability of digital research artifacts published alongside peer-reviewed journal articles (e.g. data, models, code, directions for use) and reproducibility of article results. We used the tool to assess 360 of the 1,989 articles published by six hydrology and water resources journals in 2017. Like studies from other fields, we reproduced results for only a small fraction of articles (1.6\% of tested articles) using their available artifacts. We estimated, with 95\% confidence, that results might be reproduced for only 0.6\% to 6.8\% of all 1,989 articles. Unlike prior studies, the survey tool identified key bottlenecks to making work more reproducible. Bottlenecks include: only some digital artifacts available (44\% of articles), no directions (89\%), or all artifacts available but results not reproducible (5\%). The tool (or extensions) can help authors, journals, funders, and institutions to self-assess manuscripts, provide feedback to improve reproducibility, and recognize and reward reproducible articles as examples for others.},

Evidence from dozens of meta-analyses finds robust evidence of this correlation and that small-sample studies typically have higher heterogeneity. This correlated heterogeneity violates the random-effects (RE) model of additive and independent heterogeneity. When small studies not only have inadequate statistical power but also high heterogeneity, their scientific contribution is even more dubious. When the heterogeneity variance is correlated with the sampling-error variance to the degree we find, simulations show that RE is dominated by an alternative weighted average, the unrestricted weighted least squares (UWLS). Meta-research evidence combined with simulations establish that UWLS should replace RE as the conventional meta-analysis summary of psychological research.},

Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

One of the most prominent questionable research practices is               p               -hacking. Typically,               p               -hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these               p               -hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12               p               -hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies.

Our results show that investigating               p               -hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of               p               -hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of               p               -hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of               p               -hacking in practice.},

The large majority of these practices were associated with confirmatory goals, which we suspect stem from students' prior exposure to verification labs.

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}Use of machine learning (ML) in clinical research is growing steadily given the increasing availability of complex clinical data sets. ML presents important advantages in terms of predictive performance and identifying undiscovered subpopulations of patients with specific physiology and prognoses. Despite this popularity, many clinicians and researchers are not yet familiar with evaluating and interpreting ML analyses. Consequently, readers and peer-reviewers alike may either overestimate or underestimate the validity and credibility of an ML-based model. Conversely, ML experts without clinical experience may present details of the analysis that are too granular for a clinical readership to assess. Overwhelming evidence has shown poor reproducibility and reporting of ML models in clinical research suggesting the need for ML analyses to be presented in a clear, concise, and comprehensible manner to facilitate understanding and critical evaluation. We present a recommendation for transparent and structured reporting of ML analysis results specifically directed at clinical researchers. Furthermore, we provide a list of key reporting elements with examples that can be used as a template when preparing and submitting ML-based manuscripts for the same audience.},

Vote counting and pooling unweighted averages are widespread despite the superiority of syntheses based on weighted combination of effects.

Meta-analyses are required to generalize in ecology, and to inform evidence-based decision-making, but the more sophisticated statistical techniques and registers of research used in other disciplines must be employed in ecology to fully realize their benefits.},

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%. We find this policy-author remission of data and code postpublication upon request-an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.},

Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development. The guidance provided here is not intended to be a strict rulebook; rather, the suggestions for practices and tools to advance reproducible, sound data-intensive analysis may furnish support for both students new to research and current researchers who are new to data-intensive work.},

  abstract = {Aim Species distribution modelling is commonly used to guide future conserva- tion policies in the light of potential climate change. However, arbitrary decisions during the model-building process can affect predictions and contribute to uncer- tainty about where suitable climate space will exist. For many species, the key climatic factors limiting distributions are unknown. This paper assesses the uncer- tainty generated by using different climate predictor variable sets for modelling the impacts of climate change. Location Europe, 10{$^\circ$} W to 50{$^\circ$} E and 30{$^\circ$} N to 60{$^\circ$} N. Methods Using 1453 presence pixels at 30 arcsec resolution for the great bustard (Otis tarda), predictions of future distribution were made based on two emissions scenarios, three general climate models and 26 sets of predictor variables. Twenty- six current models were created, and 156 for both 2050 and 2080. Map comparison techniques were used to compare predictions in terms of the quantity and the location of presences (map comparison kappa, MCK) and using a range change index (RCI). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to partition explained deviance in MCK and RCI among sources of uncertainty. Results The26differentvariablesetsachievedhighvaluesofAUC(areaunderthe receiver operating characteristic curve) and yet introduced substantial variation into maps of current distribution. Differences between maps were even greater when distributions were projected into the future. Some 64--78\% of the variation between future maps was attributable to choice of predictor variable set alone. Choice of general climate model and emissions scenario contributed a maximum of 15\% variation and their order of importance differed for MCK and RCI. Main conclusions Generalized variable sets produce an unmanageable level of uncertainty in species distribution models which cannot be ignored. The use of sound ecological theory and statistical methods to check predictor variables can reduce this uncertainty, but our knowledge of species may be too limited to make more than arbitrary choices. When all sources of modelling uncertainty are con- sidered together, it is doubtful whether ensemble methods offer an adequate solu- tion. Future studies should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty due to arbitrary choices in the model-building process and develop ways to convey the results to decision-makers.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are increasing in size and severity and fire seasons are lengthening, largely driven by climate and land-use change. Many plant species from fire-prone ecosystems are adapted to specific fire regimes corresponding to historical conditions and shifts beyond these bounds may have severe impacts on vegetation recovery and long-term species persistence. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of field-based studies across different vegetation types and climate regions to investigate how post-fire plant recruitment, reproduction and survival are affected by fires that occur outside of the historical fire season. We find that fires outside of the historical fire season may lead to decreased post-fire recruitment, particularly in obligate seeding species. Conversely, we find a general increase in post-fire survival in resprouting species. Our results highlight the trade-offs that exist when considering the effects of changes in the seasonal timing of fire, an already present aspect of climate-related fire regime change.},

We evaluated data availability in research articles across nine disciplines in Nature and Science magazines and recorded corresponding authors' concerns, requests and reasons for declining data sharing. Although data sharing has improved in the last decade and particularly in recent years, data availability and willingness to share data still differ greatly among disciplines. We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders.

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}The use of ecological niche models (ENM) to generate potential geographic distributions of species has rapidly increased in ecology, conservation and evolutionary biology. Many methods are available and the most used are Maximum Entropy Method (MAXENT) and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production (GARP). Recent studies have shown that MAXENT perform better than GARP. Here we used the statistics methods of ROC - AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) and bootstrap to evaluate the performance of GARP and MAXENT in generate potential distribution models for 39 species of New World coral snakes. We found that values of AUC for GARP ranged from 0.923 to 0.999, whereas those for MAXENT ranged from 0.877 to 0.999. On the whole, the differences in AUC were very small, but for 10 species GARP outperformed MAXENT. Means and standard deviations for 100 bootstrapped samples with sample sizes ranging from 3 to 30 species did not show any trends towards deviations from a zero difference in AUC values of GARP minus AUC values of MAXENT. Ours results suggest that further studies are still necessary to establish under which circumstances the statistical performance of the methods vary. However, it is also important to consider the possibility that this empirical inductive reasoning may fail in the end, because we almost certainly could not establish all potential scenarios generating variation in the relative performance of models.},

We use three data sets on plant height over time and two validation methods-in-sample model fit and leave-one-species-out cross-validation-to evaluate non-linear growth model predictive performance based on functional traits. In-sample measures of model fit differed substantially from out-of-sample model predictive performance; the best fitting models were rarely the best predictive models. Careful selection of predictor variables reduced the bias in parameter estimates, and there was no single best model across our three data sets. Testing and comparing multiple model forms is important. We developed an R package with a formula interface for straightforward fitting and validation of hierarchical, non-linear growth models. Our intent is to encourage thorough testing of multiple growth model forms and an increased emphasis on assessing model fit relative to a model's purpose.},

We consider the problem of determining spatial and temporal priorities for revegetation to maximize habitat for 62 bird species within a heavily cleared agricultural region, 11000 km2 in area. We show how a reserve-selection framework can be applied to a complex, large-scale restoration-planning problem to account for multi-species objectives and connectivity requirements at a spatial extent and resolution relevant to management. Our approach explicitly accounts for time lags in planting and development of habitat resources, which is intended to avoid future population bottlenecks caused by delayed provision of critical resources, such as tree hollows. We coupled species-specific models of expected habitat quality and fragmentation effects with the dynamics of habitat suitability following replanting to produce species-specific maps for future times. Spatial priorities for restoration were determined by ranking locations (150-m grid cells) by their expected contribution to species habitat through time using the conservation planning tool, "Zonation." We evaluated solutions by calculating expected trajectories of habitat availability for each species. We produced a spatially explicit revegetation schedule for the region that resulted in a balanced increase in habitat for all species. Priority areas for revegetation generally were clustered around existing vegetation, although not always. Areas on richer soils and with high rainfall were more highly ranked, reflecting their potential to support high-quality habitats that have been disproportionately cleared for agriculture. Accounting for delayed development of habitat resources altered the rank-order of locations in the derived revegetation plan and led to improved expected outcomes for fragmentation-sensitive species. This work demonstrates the potential for systematic restoration planning at large scales that accounts for multiple objectives, which is urgently needed by land and natural resource managers.},

  abstract = {Numerous arguments strongly support the practice of open science, which offers several societal and individual benefits. For individual researchers, sharing research artifacts such as data can increase trust and transparency, improve the reproducibility of one's own work, and catalyze new collaborations. Despite a general appreciation of the benefits of data sharing, research data are often only available to the original investigators. For data that are shared, lack of useful metadata and documentation make them challenging to reuse. In this paper, we argue that a lack of incentives and infrastructure for making data useful is the biggest barrier to creating a culture of widespread data sharing. We compare data with code, examine computational environments in the context of their ability to facilitate the reproducibility of research, provide some practical guidance on how one can improve the chances of their data being reusable, and partially bridge the incentive gap. While previous papers have focused on describing ideal best practices for data and code, we focus on common-sense ideas for sharing tabular data for a target audience of academics working in data science adjacent fields who are about to submit for publication.},

All three models predict that, on average, productivity increases asymptotically with the original biodiversity of a community. The two models that address plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies greatly among the models. This theory reinforces recent experimental results and shows that effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning are predicted by well-known ecological processes.},

  abstract = {Species interaction networks are traditionally explored as discrete entities with well-defined spatial borders, an oversimplification likely impairing their applicability. Using a multilayer network approach, explicitly accounting for inter-habitat connectivity, we investigate the spatial structure of seed-dispersal networks across the Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique. We show that the overall seed-dispersal network is composed by spatially explicit communities of dispersers spanning across habitats, functionally linking the landscape mosaic. Inter-habitat connectivity determines spatial structure, which cannot be accurately described with standard monolayer approaches either splitting or merging habitats. Multilayer modularity cannot be predicted by null models randomizing either interactions within each habitat or those linking habitats; however, as habitat connectivity increases, random processes become more important for overall structure. The importance of dispersers for the overall network structure is captured by multilayer versatility but not by standard metrics. Highly versatile species disperse many plant species across multiple habitats, being critical to landscape functional cohesion.},

Management and applied psychology have not embraced preregistration in the way other closely related social science fields have. There may be concerns that preregistration does not add value and prevents exploratory data analyses. Using a mixed-method approach, in Study 1, we compared published preregistered samples against published non-preregistered samples. We found that preregistration effectively facilitated more transparent reporting based on criteria (i.e., confirmed hypotheses and a priori analysis plans). Moreover, consistent with concerns that the published literature contains elevated type I error rates, preregistered samples had fewer statistically significant results (48\%) than non-preregistered samples (66\%). To learn about the perceived advantages, disadvantages, and misconceptions of study preregistration, in Study 2, we surveyed authors of preregistered studies and authors who had never preregistered a study. Participants in both samples had positive inclinations towards preregistration yet expressed concerns about the process. We conclude with a review of best practices for management and applied psychology stakeholders.},

However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

Research code is typically created by a group of scientists and published together with academic papers to facilitate research transparency and reproducibility. For this study, we define ten questions to address aspects impacting research reproducibility and reuse. First, we retrieve and analyze more than 2000 replication datasets with over 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020. Second, we execute the code in a clean runtime environment to assess its ease of reuse. Common coding errors were identified, and some of them were solved with automatic code cleaning to aid code execution. We find that 74\% of R files failed to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56\% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices. We also analyze the replication datasets from journals' collections and discuss the impact of the journal policy strictness on the code re-execution rate. Finally, based on our results, we propose a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at researchers, journals, and repositories.},

The cost of production, availability of the requisite expertise and timeliness are often quoted as major contributors for the delay. This detailed survey of the state of the art of information systems designed to support or automate individual tasks in the systematic review, and in particular systematic reviews of randomized controlled clinical trials, reveals trends that see the convergence of several parallel research projects.We surveyed literature describing informatics systems that support or automate the processes of systematic review or each of the tasks of the systematic review. Several projects focus on automating, simplifying and/or streamlining specific tasks of the systematic review. Some tasks are already fully automated while others are still largely manual. In this review, we describe each task and the effect that its automation would have on the entire systematic review process, summarize the existing information system support for each task, and highlight where further research is needed for realizing automation for the task. Integration of the systems that automate systematic review tasks may lead to a revised systematic review workflow. We envisage the optimized workflow will lead to system in which each systematic review is described as a computer program that automatically retrieves relevant trials, appraises them, extracts and synthesizes data, evaluates the risk of bias, performs meta-analysis calculations, and produces a report in real time.},

However, the cross-validated performance of the best configuration is optimistically biased. We present an efficient bootstrap method that corrects for the bias, called Bootstrap Bias Corrected CV (BBC-CV). BBC-CV's main idea is to bootstrap the whole process of selecting the best-performing configuration on the out-of-sample predictions of each configuration, without additional training of models. In comparison to the alternatives, namely the nested cross-validation (Varma and Simon in BMC Bioinform 7(1):91, 2006) and a method by Tibshirani and Tibshirani (Ann Appl Stat 822-829, 2009), BBC-CV is computationally more efficient, has smaller variance and bias, and is applicable to any metric of performance (accuracy, AUC, concordance index, mean squared error). Subsequently, we employ again the idea of bootstrapping the out-of-sample predictions to speed up the CV process. Specifically, using a bootstrap-based statistical criterion we stop training of models on new folds of inferior (with high probability) configurations. We name the method Bootstrap Bias Corrected with Dropping CV (BBCD-CV) that is both efficient and provides accurate performance estimates.},

We address this issue within a general statistical framework that also allows us to include various questionable research practices (QRPs) that are thought to reduce replicability. The analyses indicate that the base rate of true effects is the major factor that determines the replication rate of scientific results. Specifically, for purely statistical reasons, replicability is low in research domains where true effects are rare (e.g., search for effective drugs in pharmacology). This point is under-appreciated in current scientific and media discussions of replicability, which often attribute poor replicability mainly to QRPs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}While the hypothetico-deductive approach, which includes inductive and deductive reasoning, is largely recognized in scientific reasoning, there is not much focus on abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning describes the theory-based attempt of explaining a phenomenon by a cause. By integrating abductive reasoning into a framework for modeling competence, we strengthen the idea of modeling being a key practice of science. The framework for modeling competence theoretically describes competence levels structuring the modeling process into model construction and model application. The aim of this theoretical paper is to extend the framework for modeling competence by including abductive reasoning, with impact on the whole modeling process. Abductive reasoning can be understood as knowledge expanding in the process of model construction. In combination with deductive reasoning in model application, such inferences might enrich modeling processes. Abductive reasoning to explain a phenomenon from the best fitting guess is important for model construction and may foster the deduction of hypotheses from the model and further testing them empirically. Recent studies and examples of learners' performance in modeling processes support abductive reasoning being a part of modeling competence within scientific reasoning. The extended framework can be used for teaching and learning to foster scientific reasoning competences within modeling processes.},

  abstract = {Invasive species threaten biological diversity throughout the world. Understanding the dynamics of their spread is critical to mitigating this threat. In Australia, efforts are underway to control the invasive cane toad ( Chaunus [ Bufo ] marinus ). Range models based on their native bioclimatic envelope suggest that the cane toad is nearing the end of its invasion phase. However, such models assume a conserved niche between native and invaded regions and the absence of evolution to novel habitats. Here, we develop a dynamically updated statistical model to predict the growing extent of cane toad range based on their current distribution in Australia. Results demonstrate that Australian cane toads may already have the ability to spread across an area that almost doubles their current range and that triples projections based on their native distribution. Most of the expansion in suitable habitat area has occurred in the last decade and in regions characterized by high temperatures. Increasing use of extreme habitats may indicate that novel ecological conditions have facilitated a broader realized niche or that toad populations at the invasion front have evolved greater tolerance to extreme abiotic conditions. Rapid evolution to novel habitats combined with ecological release from native enemies may explain why some species become highly successful global invaders. Predicting species ranges following invasion or climate change may often require dynamically updated range models that incorporate a broader realization of niches in the absence of natural enemies and evolution in response to novel habitats.},

  abstract = {Science is a complex task. It involves the creation and dissemination of knowledge. The creation of knowledge requires identifying and abstracting patterns (i.e., identifying phenomena and theorizing about the processes that bring it about), as well as systematically observing to better see and quantify the patterns (e.g., effect size estimating) or assess the validity of the abstractions used to explain the patterns (i.e., theory testing). To help (a) hone in on what observations would be useful and (b) communicate what the patterns mean, we are encouraged to develop and report hypotheses. That is, strategically, hypotheses facilitate the planning of data collection by helping the researcher understand what patterns need to be observed to assess the merit of an explanation. Meanwhile, tactically, hypotheses help focus the audience on the crucial patterns needed to answer a question or test a theory. When the strategic hypotheses are not supported, it raises a question regarding what to do tactically. Depending on the result (i.e., different direction; null), one might construct a hypothesis to facilitate dissemination without reporting this post hoc construction or remove mention of a hypothesis altogether. This practice is called HARKing (i.e., hypothesizing after results are known). HARKing has been so disparaged as to be considered a ``detrimental research practice'' (Grand et al., 2018, p. 6). As such, the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology's (SIOP) Robust and Reliability Science task force appears to be recommending that HARKing not be taught by educators, encouraged by reviewers or editors, or practiced by authors. I do not agree with those recommendations, and I elaborate on my position below.},

In the validate package, validation rules are objects of computation that can be manipulated, investigated, and confronted with data or versions of a data set. The results of a confrontation are then available for further investigation, summarization or visualization. Validation rules can also be endowed with metadata and documentation and they may be stored or retrieved from external sources such as text files or tabular formats. This data validation infrastructure thus allows for systematic, user-defined definition of data quality requirements that can be reused for various versions of a data set or by data correction algorithms that are parameterized by validation rules.},

This paper introduces the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS): A step-by-step procedure that researchers can follow to make a research project open and reproducible. This workflow intends to lower the threshold for adoption of open science principles. It is based on established best practices, and can be used either in parallel to, or in absence of, top-down requirements by journals, institutions, and funding bodies. To facilitate widespread adoption, the WORCS principles have been implemented in the R package worcs, which offers an RStudio project template and utility functions for specific workflow steps. This paper introduces the conceptual workflow, discusses how it meets different standards for open science, and addresses the functionality provided by the R implementation, worcs. This paper is primarily targeted towards scholars conducting research projects in R, conducting research that involves academic prose, analysis code, and tabular data. However, the workflow is flexible enough to accommodate other scenarios, and offers a starting point for customized solutions. The source code for the R package and manuscript, and a list of examplesof WORCS projects, are available at https://github.com/cjvanlissa/worcs.},

Conservation biologists often rely on one type of corridor model, typically the least-cost model or current flow model, to construct a linkage design, with little theoretical and empirical support for their choice. We developed a method to empirically confirm whether corridors produced by these two models are used by target species in current landscape conditions. We applied this method in the Gamba landscape between two national parks in southwestern Gabon. We collected signs of presence of African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and two apes -- western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) -- on transects and used patch occupancy models to identify least-cost and current flow corridors for these three focal taxa. On average, only 28.7\% of current flow corridors overlapped with least-cost corridors, confirming that the choice of the corridor model can affect the location of the resulting linkage design. We validated these corridors by monitoring signs and camera detections on new transects within and outside modeled corridors. Current flow corridors performed better than least- cost corridors for elephants, whereas the opposite was found for buffalo and apes. Locations of the highest priority corridors for the three taxa did not overlap, and only 18.3\% of their combined surface was common among two species. We used centrality metrics to calculate the average contribution of corridor pixels to landscape connectivity and derived an index that can be used to prioritize corridors. As a result, we recommend protecting at least 17.4\% of the land surface area around Gamba town to preserve the preferred travel routes of all target species.},

It is shown that this function may be readily incorporated into the age-specific probability of survival in a Leslie-matrix population model. A method is presented for indirectly determining the probability of survival for age-class 0 of a fish population using a density-dependent Leslie matrix. The method involves the two constraints that the population be at equilibrium and that the index of absolute population size in the density-dependent function be assigned a value. In addition, given the probability of survival for age-class 0, it is shown that the probability of survival through a selected life stage within age-class 0 can be indirectly determined. Three problems in modeling a fish population using a Leslie model are discussed in light of the difficulties involved in modeling density dependence due to insufficient information and lack of understanding concerning density-dependent phenomena.},

With refined international commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity to target protected areas in places of "importance to biodiversity," perhaps they may now be. We analyzed location biases in PAs globally over historic (pre-2004) and recent periods. Specifically, we examined whether the location of protected areas are more closely associated with high concentrations of threatened vertebrate species or with areas of low agricultural opportunity costs. We found that both old and new protected areas did not target places with high concentrations of threatened vertebrate species. Instead, they appeared to be established in locations that minimize conflict with agriculturally suitable lands. This entrenchment of past trends has substantial implications for the contributions these protected areas are making to international commitments to conserve biodiversity. If protected-area growth from 2004 to 2014 had strategically targeted unrepresented threatened vertebrates, {$>$}30 times more species (3086 or 2553 potential vs. 85 actual new species represented) would have been protected for the same area or the same cost as the actual expansion. With the land available for conservation declining, nations must urgently focus new protection on places that provide for the conservation outcomes outlined in international treaties.},

Species distribution models are often implemented using a wide variety of machine learning algorithms that can be fine-tuned to achieve the best model prediction while avoiding overfitting. We have released SDMtune, a new R package that aims to facilitate training, tuning, and evaluation of species distribution models in a unified framework. The main innovations of this package are its functions to perform data-driven variable selection, and a novel genetic algorithm to tune model hyperparameters. Real-time and interactive charts are displayed during the execution of several functions to help users understand the effect of removing a variable or varying model hyperparameters on model performance. SDMtune supports three different metrics to evaluate model performance: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the true skill statistic, and Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample sizes. It implements four statistical methods: artificial neural networks, boosted regression trees, maximum entropy modeling, and random forest. Moreover, it includes functions to display the outputs and create a final report. SDMtune therefore represents a new, unified and user-friendly framework for the still-growing field of species distribution modeling.},

Several cases of spectacular failures to replicate findings published in the primary scientific literature have led to a perceived reproducibility crisis. Diverse threats to reproducibility have been proposed, including lack of scientific rigour, low statistical power, publication bias, analytical flexibility and fraud. An important aspect that is generally overlooked is the lack of external validity caused by rigorous standardization of both the animals and the environment. Here, we argue that a reaction norm approach to phenotypic variation, acknowledging gene-by-environment interactions, can help us seeing reproducibility of animal experiments in a new light. We illustrate how dominating environmental effects can affect inference and effect size estimates of studies and how elimination of dominant factors through standardization affects the nature of the expected phenotype variation through the reaction norms of small effect. Finally, we discuss the consequences of reaction norms of small effect for statistical analysis, specifically for random effect latent variable models and the random lab model.},

We here aimed at proposing a new experimental strategy that transfers this logic into a single-laboratory setting. We systematically introduced heterogeneity into our study population by splitting an experiment into several 'mini-experiments' spread over different time points a few weeks apart. We hypothesised to observe improved reproducibility in such a 'mini-experiment' design in comparison to a conventionally standardised design, according to which all animals are tested at one specific point in time. By comparing both designs across independent replicates, we could indeed show that the use of such a 'mini-experiment' design improved the reproducibility and accurate detection of exemplary treatment effects (behavioural and physiological differences between four mouse strains) in about half of all investigated strain comparisons. Thus, we successfully implemented and empirically validated an easy-to-handle strategy to tackle poor reproducibility in single-laboratory studies. Since other experiments within different life science disciplines share the main characteristics with the investigation reported here, these studies are likely to also benefit from this approach.},

As there are always numerous flexibilities in data-analytic decisions (a ``garden of forking paths''), this poses perennial problems to all empirical research. Specification-curve analysis and multiverse analysis have recently been proposed as solutions to these issues. Building on the structural analogies between primary data analysis and meta-analysis, we transform and adapt these approaches to the meta-analytic level, in tandem with combinatorial meta-analysis. We explain the rationale of this idea, suggest descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, as well as graphical displays, provide code for meta-analytic practitioners to generate and use these, and present a fully worked real example from digit ratio (2D:4D) research, totaling 1,592 meta-analytic specifications. Specification-curve and multiverse meta-analysis holds promise to resolve conflicting meta-analyses, contested evidence, controversial empirical literatures, and polarized research, and to mitigate the associated detrimental effects of these phenomena on research progress.},

  abstract = {The veracity of substantive research claims hinges on the way experimental data are collected and analyzed. In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology's academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result-a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label "confirmatory," and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled "exploratory." We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception.},

For example, Strack, Martin, and Stepper (1988) instructed participants to rate the funniness of cartoons using a pen that they held in their mouth. In line with the facial feedback hypothesis, when participants held the pen with their teeth (inducing a ``smile''), they rated the cartoons as funnier than when they held the pen with their lips (inducing a ``pout''). This seminal study of the facial feedback hypothesis has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 17 independent direct replications of Study 1 from Strack et al. (1988), all of which followed the same vetted protocol. A meta-analysis of these studies examined the difference in funniness ratings between the ``smile'' and ``pout'' conditions. The original Strack et al. (1988) study reported a rating difference of 0.82 units on a 10-point Likert scale. Our meta-analysis revealed a rating difference of 0.03 units with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from -0.11 to 0.16.},

Using potential legitimate pollinators that were constantly visiting flowers in two alpine meadow communities, we analyzed the differences in the pollination network structure between the pollinator individual level and species level. The results showed that compared to the pollinator species-based networks, the linkage density, interaction diversity, interaction evenness, the average plant linkage level, and interaction diversity increased, but connectance, degree of nestedness, the average of pollinator linkage level, and interaction diversity decreased in the pollinator individual-based networks, indicating that pollinator individuals had a narrower food niche than their counterpart species. Pollination networks at the pollinator individual level were more specialized at the network level (H'\textsubscript{2}) and the plant species node level (d') than at the pollinator species-level networks, reducing the chance of underestimating levels of specialization in pollination systems. The results emphasize that research into pollinator individual-based pollination networks will improve our understanding of the pollination networks at the pollinator species level and the coevolution of flowering plants and pollinators.},

The debate is primarily focused on methodological issues. However, examples such as the use of misidentified cell lines illustrate that the availability of reliable methods does not guarantee good practice. Moreover, research is often characterised by a lack of established methods. Despite the crucial importance of researcher conduct, research and conclusive data on the determinants of researcher behaviour are widely missing. Conclusion:  Meta-research is urgently needed that establishes an understanding of the factors that determine researcher behaviour. This knowledge can then be used to implement and iteratively improve measures, which incentivise researchers to apply the highest standards resulting in high quality data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Crowdsourcing is a nascent phenomenon that has grown exponentially since it was coined in 2006. It involves a large group of people solving a problem or completing a task for an individual or, more commonly, for an organisation. While the field of crowdsourcing has developed more quickly in information technology, it has great promise in health applications. This review examines uses of crowdsourcing in global health and health, broadly. METHODS:  Semantic searches were run in Google Scholar for "crowdsourcing," "crowdsourcing and health," and similar terms. 996 articles were retrieved and all abstracts were scanned. 285 articles related to health. This review provides a narrative overview of the articles identified. RESULTS:  Eight areas where crowdsourcing has been used in health were identified: diagnosis; surveillance; nutrition; public health and environment; education; genetics; psychology; and, general medicine/other. Many studies reported crowdsourcing being used in a diagnostic or surveillance capacity. Crowdsourcing has been widely used across medical disciplines; however, it is important for future work using crowdsourcing to consider the appropriateness of the crowd being used to ensure the crowd is capable and has the adequate knowledge for the task at hand. Gamification of tasks seems to improve accuracy; other innovative methods of analysis including introducing thresholds and measures of trustworthiness should be considered. CONCLUSION:  Crowdsourcing is a new field that has been widely used and is innovative and adaptable. With the exception of surveillance applications that are used in emergency and disaster situations, most uses of crowdsourcing have only been used as pilots. These exceptions demonstrate that it is possible to take crowdsourcing applications to scale. Crowdsourcing has the potential to provide more accessible health care to more communities and individuals rapidly and to lower costs of care.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}ObjectiveIn psychometric validation there are a near limitless number of different approaches researchers can decide to take when choosing sample type and size, test metrics, and covariate measures. It is particularly important to factor in these different analytical pathways when validating tools intended for use in clinical populations. Here, we aimed to provide a tutorial paper showcasing the multiverse, or specification curve, technique to establish the robustness of analytical pathways on psychometric validation outcomes in an example test of executive function. MethodWe examined the impact of choices regarding sample groups, sample sizes, different types of metrics from a given test, covariate inclusions, and outlier removal on convergent validation correlations between new tests of executive function. Data were available for 88 neurologically healthy adults and 117 stroke survivors, a total of 6,660 different analyses were run. ResultsWe found that the type of sample group and sample size used for analyses impacted validation outcomes. Comparing test metrics within-category (e.g. accuracy vs accuracy) rather than between-category (e.g., accuracy vs time) significantly increased the observed correlation coefficients. Covariate inclusion and outlier removal choices did not impact the observed coefficients in our analyses. ConclusionThis tutorial paper showcases how authors can use the multiverse technique to evidence the robustness, or fragility, of their validation outcomes across many different analytical pathways. The example here highlights the importance of fully justifying and considering the analytical pathway to take in validation work on clinically relevant tools.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}The worst performance rule (WPR) is a robust empirical finding reflecting that people's worst task performance shows numerically stronger correlations with cognitive ability than their average or best performance. However, recent meta-analytic work has proposed this be renamed the ``not-best performance'' rule because mean and worst performance seem to predict cognitive ability to similar degrees, with both predicting ability better than best performance. We re-analyzed data from a previously published latent-variable study to test for worst vs. not-best performance across a variety of reaction time tasks in relation to two cognitive ability constructs: working memory capacity (WMC) and propensity for task-unrelated thought (TUT). Using two methods of assessing worst performance---ranked-binning and ex-Gaussian-modeling approaches---we found evidence for both the worst and not-best performance rules. WMC followed the not-best performance rule (correlating equivalently with mean and longest response times (RTs)) but TUT propensity followed the worst performance rule (correlating more strongly with longest RTs). Additionally, we created a mini-multiverse following different outlier exclusion rules to test the robustness of our findings; our findings remained stable across the different multiverse iterations. We provisionally conclude that the worst performance rule may only arise in relation to cognitive abilities closely linked to (failures of) sustained attention.},

Packages markedly extend R's utility and ameliorate inefficient solutions to data science problems. We outline 10 simple rules for finding relevant packages and determining which package is best for your desired use. We begin in Rule 1 with tips on how to consider your purpose, which will guide your search to follow, where, in Rule 2, you'll learn best practices for finding and collecting options. Rules 3 and 4 will help you navigate packages' profiles and explore the extent of their online resources, so that you can be confident in the quality of the package you choose and assured that you'll be able to access support. In Rules 5 and 6, you'll become familiar with how the R Community evaluates packages and learn how to assess the popularity and utility of packages for yourself. Rules 7 and 8 will teach you how to investigate and track package development processes, so you can further evaluate their merit. We end in Rules 9 and 10 with more hands-on approaches, which involve digging into package code.},

  abstract = {In 2001, Anderson and Green [2001. Suppressing unwanted memories by executive control. Nature, 410(6826), 366-369] showed memory suppression using a novel Think/No-think (TNT) task. When participants attempted to prevent studied words from entering awareness, they reported fewer of those words than baseline words in subsequent cued recall (i.e., suppression effect). The TNT literature contains predominantly positive findings and few null-results. Therefore we report unpublished replications conducted in the 2000s (N\,=\,49; N\,=\,36). As the features of the data obtained with the TNT task call for a variety of plausible solutions, we report parallel "universes" of data-analyses (i.e., multiverse analysis) testing the suppression effect. Two published studies (Wessel et al., 2005. Dissociation and memory suppression: A comparison of high and low dissociative individuals' performance on the Think-No think Task. Personality and Individual Differences, 39(8), 1461-1470, N\,=\,68; Wessel et al., 2010. Cognitive control and suppression of memories of an emotional film.

For recall probed with studied cues (Same Probes, SP), some tests (sample 3) or all (samples 2 and 4) showed statistically significant suppression effects, whereas in sample 1, only one test showed significance. Recall probed with novel cues (Independent Probes, IP) predominantly rendered non-significant results. The absence of statistically significant IP suppression effects raises problems for inhibition theory and its implication that repression is a viable mechanism of forgetting. The pre-registration, materials, data, and code are publicly available (https://osf.io/qgcy5/).},

A general ANOVA design is any experimental design that can be described by some variety of ANOVA model. Surprisingly, a power analysis program for general ANOVA designs did not exist until now. PANGEA can estimate power for designs that consist of any number of factors, each with any number of levels; any factor can be considered fixed or random; and any possible pattern of nesting or crossing of the factors is allowed. I demonstrate how PANGEA can be used to estimate power for anything from simple between- and within-subjects designs, to more complicated designs with multiple random factors (e.g., multilevel designs and crossed-random- effects designs). I document the statistical theory underlying PANGEA and describe some experimental features to be added in the near future.},

  doi = {10.1101/262881},
  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of summarizing scientific information, incorporating a range of methods including systematic reviews, systematic maps, and meta-analyses. ES is critical for translating scientific information into recommendations for management or policy, but is becoming increasingly challenging due to rapid growth in publication of scientific literature. From a computational perspective, the ES process can be viewed as a sequence of operations on bibliographic data, including importing, de-duplicating, and classifying large numbers of articles or reports. These are common tasks in natural language processing and machine learning, yet few software tools are available to help researchers access these techniques for manipulating bibliographic data in a systematic way. Here, I present revtools, an R package for exploratory investigation of bibliographic data during reviews and evidence syntheses. It provides tools for the import and de-duplication of bibliographic data formats, and cluster analysis and visualization of article titles, abstracts and keywords using topics models. The key function of revtools is an interactive viewer window that allows users to view and select and export the articles, terms or topics most relevant to their study. Rather than generating lists of text commonly provided by other article sorting software, revtools displays this content as points in an ordination cloud, allowing rapid, intuitive assessment of patterns within the corpus. These tools will assist users to identify key topics and outlying articles or terms, increasing the navigability and ease of processing of bibliographic datasets.},

  abstract = {We formulate the optimal landscape reconstruction problem for 22 birds in the Mount Lofty Ranges (MLR), South Australia. The goal is to determine landscape configurations with revegetation that would maximize the projected number of bird species present across all revegetated sites in the landscape. We use simulated annealing and an iterative improvement heuristic algorithm to find the efficient solutions for different objective functions and budget sizes. Under scenarios assuming that possible sites for revegetation have equal costs, our analyses suggest that revegetation programs in the region should strive to create landscapes with a mean revegetation patch size ranging from 780 to 4010 ha. The inclusion of property value data as surrogates for revegetation costs results in optimal landscapes with more highly irreplaceable (priority) sites in less expensive parts of the region and smaller average patch sizes. This illustrates how the solutions to landscape design problems change with different assumptions of economic cost. The paper represents one of the first uses of decision-modeling tools for optimal habitat restoration on a real landscape. The software and methodology have applicability for general landscape design outside the Mount Lofty Ranges.},

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a frequently used estimate to describe the discriminatory ability of a clinical prediction model. The AUC is often interpreted relative to thresholds, with ``good'' or ``excellent'' models defined at 0.7, 0.8 or 0.9. These thresholds may create targets that result in ``hacking'', where researchers are motivated to re-analyse their data until they achieve a ``good'' result. We extracted AUC values from PubMed abstracts to look for evidence of hacking. We used histograms of the AUC values in bins of size 0.01 and compared the observed distribution to a smooth distribution from a spline. The distribution of 306,888 AUC values showed clear excesses above the thresholds of 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 and shortfalls below the thresholds. The AUCs for some models are over-inflated, which risks exposing patients to sub-optimal clinical decision-making. Greater modelling transparency is needed, including published protocols, and data and code sharing.},

The author presents some empirical results highlighting problems that lower the trustworthiness of reported results in scientific literatures, including that of animal welfare studies. Some of the underlying causes of these biases are discussed based on the notion that researchers are only human and hence are not immune to confirmation bias, hindsight bias, and minor ethical transgressions.

We assessed how both the spatial attributes of remnant patches (area and isolation) and landscape factors (extent of urbanization and maximum inter-fire interval) influence the persistence of native plant species in grasslands in western Victoria, Australia. Persistence was determined in 2001 by resurveying 30 remnants first surveyed in the 1980s, and correlates of extinction were assessed using Bayesian logistic regression models. On average, 26\% of populations of native species became locally extinct over two decades. Area and isolation had little effect on the probability of local extinction, but urbanization and longer maximum inter-fire intervals increased extinction risk. These findings suggest that the native grasslands studied are relatively insensitive to area- and isolation-based fragmentation effects and that short-term persistence of plant populations requires the maintenance of habitat quality. The latter is strongly influenced by the landscape matrix surrounding remnant patches through changes in fire regimes and increased exogenous disturbance.},

SDT provides a unifying analysis of three types of information: statistical results from a data set, knowledge of the consequences of potential choices (i.e., loss), and prior beliefs about a system. SDT links the theoretical development of a large body of statistical methods, including point estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation. The theory and application of SDT have mainly been developed and published in the fields of mathematics, statistics, operations research, and other decision sciences, but have had limited exposure in ecology. Thus, we provide an introduction to SDT for ecologists and describe its utility for linking the conventionally separate tasks of statistical investigation and decision making in a single framework. We~describe the basic framework of both Bayesian and frequentist SDT, its traditional use in statistics, and discuss its application to decision problems that occur in ecology. We~demonstrate SDT with two types of decisions: Bayesian point estimation and an applied management problem of selecting a prescribed fire rotation for managing a grassland bird species. Central to SDT, and decision theory in general, are loss functions. Thus, we also provide basic guidance and references for constructing loss functions for an SDT problem.},

This framework encapsulates the key elements of any problem, including the objective, the constraints, and knowledge of the system. Within the context of this framework the broad array of approaches for setting conservation priorities are reviewed. While some approaches prioritize assets or locations for conservation investment, it is concluded here that prioritization is incomplete without consideration of the conservation actions required to conserve the assets at particular locations. The challenges associated with prioritizing investments through time in the face of threats (and also spatially and temporally heterogeneous costs) can be aided by proper problem definition. Using the authors' general framework for setting conservation priorities, multiple criteria can be rationally integrated and where, how, and when to invest conservation resources can be scheduled. Trade-offs are unavoidable in priority setting when there are multiple considerations, and budgets are almost always finite. The authors discuss how trade-offs, risks, uncertainty, feedbacks, and learning can be explicitly evaluated within their generic framework for setting conservation priorities. Finally, they suggest ways that current priority-setting approaches may be improved.},

In addition to their quantitative judgements,participants  also outlined  the reasoning behind their judgements. To start, we quantitativelyanalysed some possible correlates of predictive accuracy, such as self-rated understanding andexpertise in assessing each claim, and updating of judgements after feedback and discussion.Then we qualitatively analysed the reasoning data (i.e., the comments and justifications peopleprovided for their judgements) to explore the cues and heuristics used, and features of groupdiscussion that accompanied more and less accurate judgements},

'Targeted' monitoring has been contrasted with other approaches in which a range of quantities are monitored in case they exhibit an alarming trend or provide ad hoc ecological insights. The second form of monitoring, described as surveillance, has been criticized because it does not usually aim to discern between competing hypotheses, and its benefits are harder to identify a priori. The alternative view is that the existence of surveillance data may enable rapid corroboration of emerging hypotheses or help to detect important 'unknown unknowns' that, if undetected, could lead to catastrophic outcomes or missed opportunities. We derive a model to evaluate and compare the efficiency of investments in surveillance and targeted monitoring. We find that a decision to invest in surveillance monitoring may be defensible if: (1) the surveillance design is more likely to discover or corroborate previously unknown phenomena than a targeted design and (2) the expected benefits (or avoided costs) arising from discovery are substantially higher than those arising from a well-planned targeted design. Our examination highlights the importance of being explicit about the objectives, costs and expected benefits of monitoring in a decision analytic framework.},

Yet current study is hampered by the long-known problems of inadequate management of data and insufficient description of analytical procedures, especially in the field of ecology. Despite recent institutional incentives to share data and new data archiving infrastructure, many ecologists do not archive and publish their data and code. Given current rapid rates of global change, the consequences of this are extreme: because an ecological dataset collected at a certain place and time represents an irreproducible set of observations, ecologists doing local, independent research possess, in their file cabinets and spreadsheets, a wealth of information about the natural world and how it is changing. Although large-scale initiatives will increasingly enable and reward open science, we believe that change demands action and personal commitment by individuals -- from students and PIs. Herein, we outline the major benefits of sharing data and analytical procedures in the context of global change ecology, and provide guidelines for overcoming common obstacles and concerns. If individual scientists and laboratories can embrace a culture of archiving and sharing we can accelerate the pace of the scientific method and redefine how local science can most robustly scale up to globally relevant questions.},

In this study, we investigated the relationships between water quality and landscape pattern (composition and configuration) in Huzhou City, China. The water quality variables, including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), NH3-N, petroleum, dissolved total phosphorus (DTP), and total nitrogen (TN) in low water, normal water and flood periods were identified by investigating 34 sampling sites in Huzhou City during the period from 2001 to 2007. Landscape composition and landscape configuration metrics were calculated for different scales. It was found that scales and seasons both play important role when analyzing the relationships between landscape characteristics of different land use types. The results implied that some water quality parameters such as CODMn, petroleum are more polluted in flood period than the other two seasons at different scales, while DTP and TN are more polluted in low water period. Influences of different landscape metrics on water quality should operate at different spatial scales. The results shown in this paper will effectively provide scientific basis for the policy making in sustainable development of water environment.},

However, inference can be confounded when an observed pattern cannot be clearly and wholly attributed to a hypothesized process. Over-reliance on traditional single-hypothesis methods (i.e. null hypothesis significance testing) has resulted in replication crises in several disciplines, and ecology exhibits features common to these fields (e.g. low-power study designs, questionable research practices, etc.). Considering multiple working hypotheses in combination with pre-data collection modelling can be an effective means to mitigate many of these problems. We present a framework for explicitly modelling systems in which relevant processes are commonly omitted, overlooked or not considered and provide a formal workflow for a pre-data collection analysis of multiple candidate hypotheses. We advocate for and suggest ways that pre-data collection modelling can be combined with consideration of multiple working hypotheses to improve the efficiency and accuracy of research in ecology.},

However, for many data sets it produces extremely high posterior probabilities, sometimes for apparently incorrect clades. Here we use both computer simulation and empirical data analysis to examine the effect of the prior model for internal branch lengths. We found that posterior probabilities for trees and clades are sensitive to the prior for internal branch lengths, and priors assuming long internal branches cause high posterior probabilities for trees. In particular, uniform priors with high upper bounds bias Bayesian clade probabilities in favor of extreme values. We discuss possible remedies to the problem, including empirical and full Bayesian methods and subjective procedures suggested in Bayesian hypothesis testing. Our results also suggest that the bootstrap proportion and Bayesian posterior probability are different measures of accuracy, and that the bootstrap proportion, if interpreted as the probability that the clade is true, can be either too liberal or too conservative.},

The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned -- that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology -- the linear mixed model -- I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the ``random effect'' formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

However, limited understanding of the accuracy and precision of models transferred to novel conditions (their 'transferability') undermines confidence in their predictions. Here, 50 experts identified priority knowledge gaps which, if filled, will most improve model transfers. These are summarized into six technical and six fundamental challenges, which underlie the combined need to intensify research on the determinants of ecological predictability, including species traits and data quality, and develop best practices for transferring models. Of high importance is the identification of a widely applicable set of transferability metrics, with appropriate tools to quantify the sources and impacts of prediction uncertainty under novel conditions.

  abstract = {Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response variables that are functions (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although methods for analysing function-valued data have been available for several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare. We outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function (`function regression') and introduce the r package FREE, which focuses on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented, including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on individual-size distributions (ISDs) of fish and trees. No single method performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to combine or compare fitted models. Function regression allows the direct modelling of many function-valued data (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity indices). Our ecological examples using ISD data show that larger rivers support more-even fish-size distributions than smaller rivers and that low initial planting densities lead to more-even tree-size distributions than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than conventional non-function-valued approaches.},

We developed a workflow for a long-term ecological study that addresses many of the challenges associated with managing this type of data. We do this by leveraging existing tools to 1) perform quality assurance and control; 2) import, restructure, version, and archive data; 3) rapidly publish new data in ways that ensure appropriate credit to all contributors; and 4) automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time and effort required by researchers.

It uses predictability as a reality check and considers the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design. We augment predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. We develop inference procedures that build on PCS, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to problem formulation, data cleaning, and modeling decisions. We compare PCS inference with existing methods in high-dimensional sparse linear model simulations to demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to others in terms of ROC curves over a wide range of simulation settings. Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to back up human choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and documentation are demonstrated in a genomics case study available on Zenodo.},

We hypothesize that the outcomes of retrospective comparative effectiveness research studies can be heavily influenced by biostatistical analytic choices, thereby leading to inconsistent conclusions. We selected a clinical scenario currently under investigation: survival in metastatic prostate, breast or lung cancer after systemic vs systemic + definitive local therapy. We ran {$>$}300\,000 regression models (each representing a publishable study). Each model had various forms of analytic choices (to account for bias): propensity score matching, left truncation adjustment, landmark analysis and covariate combinations. There were 72\,549 lung, 14\,904 prostate and 13\,857 breast cancer patients included. In the most basic analysis, which omitted propensity score matching, left truncation adjustment and landmark analysis, all of the HRs were {$<$}1 (generally, 0.60-0.95, favoring addition of local therapy), with all P-values {$<$}.001. Left truncation adjustment landmark analysis produced results with nonsignificant P-values. The combination of propensity score matching, left truncation adjustment, landmark analysis and covariate combinations generally produced P-values that were {$>$}.05 and/or HRs that were {$>$}1 (favoring systemic therapy alone). The use of more statistical methods to reduce the selection bias caused reported HR ranges to approach 1.0. By varying analytic choices in comparative effectiveness research, we generated contrary outcomes. Our results suggest that some retrospective observational studies may find a treatment improves outcomes for patients, while another similar study may find it does not, simply based on analytical choices.},

The present study tested whether community data may improve modelling rare species by sharing information among common and rare ones. We chose six SDMs that treat community data in different ways, including two traditional single-species models (random forest and artificial neural network) and four joint species distribution models that incorporate species associations implicitly (multivariate random forest and multi-response artificial neural network) or explicitly (hierarchical modelling of species communities and generalized joint attribute model). In addition, we evaluated two approaches of data arrangement, species filtering and conditional prediction, to enhance the selected models. The model predictions were tested using cross validation based on empirical data collected from marine fisheries surveys, and the effects of community data were evaluated by comparing models for six selected rare species. The results demonstrated that the community data improved the predictions of rare species' distributions to certain extent but might also be unhelpful in some cases. The rare species could be appropriately predicted in terms of occurrence, whereas their abundance tended to be underestimated by most models. Species filtering and conditional predictions substantially benefited the predictive performances of multiple- and single-species models, respectively. We conclude that both the modelling algorithms and community data need to be carefully selected in order to deliver improvement in modelling rare species. The study highlights the opportunity and challenges to improve prediction of rare species' distribution by making the most of community data.},

The impacts of alternative N fertilizer management practices on N loading (N loss through runoff and leaching) from paddy fields in Shanghai were assessed using a process-based biogeochemical model, DNDC. The results indicated that the current fertilization rate in paddy fields of Shanghai (300kgN/ha) exceeds the actual rice demand and has led to substantial N loading of 1142{\textpm}276kg. The combined application of urea at 150kgN/ha and organic manure at 100kgN/ha was identified as the best fertilization method for rice cultivation in Shanghai; this application maintained optimal rice yields and significantly reduced N loading to 714{\textpm}151kg in comparison with the current fertilization rate. A sensitivity test was conducted with various input parameters, and the results indicated that fertilization, precipitation and soil properties were the most sensitive factors that regulate N loss from paddy fields. The variability of soil properties, especially SOC led to high uncertainties in the simulated results. Therefore, the local climate conditions and soil properties should be taken into account in the identification of the best management practice (BMP) for rice cultivation, given the high spatially heterogeneous N loading values across all towns used in the simulation. The DNDC model is an effective approach for simulating and predicting N loading in paddy fields under alternative agricultural management practices.},

  abstract = {The properties of the human mind affect the quality of scientific knowledge through the insertion of unconscious biases during the research process. These biases frequently cause overestimation of the effects under study, thereby violating the reproducibility of the research and potentially leading to incorrect conclusions in subsequent research syntheses. We explored the level of knowledge about biases and attitudes to this problem by analysing 308 responses of ecology scientists to a specifically developed survey. We show that knowledge about biases and attitude towards biases depend on the scientist's career stage, gender and affiliation country. Early career scientists are more concerned about biases, know more about measures to avoid biases, and twice more frequently have learned about biases from their university courses when compared with senior scientists. The respondents believe that their own studies are less prone to biases than are studies by other scientists, which hampers the control of biases in one's own research. We conclude that education about biases is necessary, but not yet sufficient, to avoid biases because the unconscious origin of biases necessitates external intervention to combat them. Obligatory reporting of measures taken against biases in all relevant manuscripts will likely enhance the reproducibility of scientific results.},
