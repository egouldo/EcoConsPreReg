abstract: |
  **1.** Preregistration is an open-science practice adopted in scientific disciplines that have begun to confront the 'reproducibility crisis', which aims to improve research transparency and mitigate questionable research practices within a study. There has been little uptake of preregistration in ecology and conservation, and many modellers and researchers engaged in non-hypothesis testing research both within and outside of ecology have eschewed preregistration on the grounds that existing templates are irrelevant because they are focussed on null-hypothesis significance testing.
  **2.** We advocate that preregistration can and should be used in model-based research in ecology and conservation but that preregistration should reflect the norms and practice of the research context in which it is applied in order to adequately restrict researcher degrees of freedom that are unique to a domain-specific methodology. We took a user-centred design approach to the task of translating preregistration into model-based research contexts for ecology and conservation.
  **3.** We identified a generalised 'modelling workflow' that captures critical analysis decisions in the process of the model development cycle. The workflow informed the content and structure of a preregistration template to be used in model-based research. The iterative nature of model development was identified as a key barrier to implementing preregistration for modelling research because it conflicts with the current format and linear process of preregistration. To better align the internal logic of preregistration with the iterative and non-linear process of ecological modelling, we propose a methodology for implementing 'adaptive preregistration' leveraging git and GitHub. We tested and evaluated the preregistration template and methodology using a case-study of environmental flows modelling for decision-support in Victoria, Australia.
  **4.** This research provides a template and methodology for implementing adaptive preregistration of ecological models in either pure or applied settings, and will facilitate the wider uptake of preregistration in ecology. Although we focus on ecology and conservation in this paper, the template is extensible to alternative fields and methods, and the proposed methodology for implementing adaptive preregistration can be applied in model-based research within science more broadly. Modellers need no longer cry "but, I can't preregister my research."
