<section id="problem-formulation" class="level1">
<h1>1. Problem Formulation</h1>
<p>Includes a clear specification of the problem context in which the model will be used or designed to inform. Defining the purpose of the model is critical because the model purpose influences choices at later stages of model development (Jakeman, Letcher, and Norton 2006). This includes engaging with the decision maker and/or key stakeholders (if relevant).</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is the model for?</li>
<li>Who is involved in formulating the model?</li>
<li>Who needs buy in?</li>
<li>How key stakeholders will/wish to be involved in model development and testing</li>

<p>Briefly outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>the problem (including the decision to be made, if relevant).</li>
<li>outline how your model is to address the problem, being clear about the scope i.e.&nbsp;is your model addressing the whole problem, or part of it? Are there any linked problems that your model needs to cognisant of?.</li>
<li>The scope of the model, including temporal and spatial resolutions (Mahmoud et al.&nbsp;2009)</li>
<li>Finish with a clear statement of the purpose of your model. Common model purposes in ecology can include: gaining a better qualitative understanding of the target system, synthesising and reviewing knowledge, providing guidance for management and decision-making (Jakeman, Letcher, and Norton 2006), comparing the performance of alternative management actions under budget constraint (Fraser et al.&nbsp;2017) to search for robust decisions under uncertainty (McDonald-Madden, Baxter, and Possingham 2008), to choose the conservation policy that minimises uncertainty (Tulloch et al.&nbsp;2015).</li>

<p>Provide more detail on the analytical purpose and scope of the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will the model be analysed?</li>
<li>What analytical questions will the model be used to answer?</li>
<li>What is the intended domain in which the model is to be applied? Are there any reasonable extrapolation limits beyond which you expect the model should not be applied? (Grimm et al.&nbsp;2014)</li>
<li>Are there potentially unacceptable management or policy outcomes identified by stakeholders that should be captured in the model, i.e.&nbsp;as constraints?</li>
<li>Are there scenarios that model outputs have to accommodate? Scenarios should be set a priori, i.e.&nbsp;before the model is built, (Moallemi, Elsawah, and Ryan 2019).</li>
<li>Describe what processes you will use to elicit and identify relevant scenarios, e.g.&nbsp;literature review, structured workshops with stakeholders or decision-makers.</li>
<li>What degree of flexibility is required from the model? Might the model need to be quickly reconfigured to explore new scenarios or problems proposed by clients / managers / model-users?</li>
<li>Last, are there any limitations on model development analysis and flexibility, such as time or budget constraints, for example, does a model need to be deployed rapidly?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="output-or-response-variables" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="output-or-response-variables">1.1.4 Output (or response) variable(s)</h3>
<p>After defining the problem context, you will need to understand from key stakeholders what the outputs of the model are, and how they will be measured/modelled at the appropriate spatial and temporal scale (see 1.1.2, but to be addressed in 3.4.1).</p>
<p>In a decision context, the model outputs relate directly to the fundamental objectives (what is driving the decision, what is to be fundamentally achieved, or avoided? Gregory et al 2012). These are differentiated from means objectives, which specify means to achieving the fundamental, or end objectives. For example, improving the condition of an area of habitat, could be considered a means to improving the status of the fauna that utilise the habitat. As such, the status of the given fauna is an output (or response) variable for the model. Questions you might ask of key stakeholders to elicit the output variable(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>What variables would support taking a particular course of action (i.e.&nbsp;a decision), or help define the problem at hand?</li>
<li>What are the values to be addressed in this problem context? Are they all relevant to this model? There may be multiple objectives, which may not all be relevant in your model. It is important to capture this in the description of model scope (1.1.2). Any model variable may be qualitative or quantitative. It is the role of the modeller to ensure all variables, particularly the output variable(s) are measured at the appropriate scale. If the models are to be used in a decision context, this step is particularly crucial, as the choice of performance measure can result in substantial differences in model outputs (Giljohan et al, 2014).</li>

<ul>
<li>How will you operationalize any scenarios identified in 1.1.3? For example, how will you operationalise any qualitative changes of interest, such as ‚ ‘deterioration’ or ‘improvement’?</li>
<li>Describe how you will evaluate and distinguish the performance of alternative scenario outcomes. Examples include: descriptive statistic measures, such as a model in the top 10th percentile of worst conditions, satisficing measures such as a minimum performance threshold for achieving some management objective, or perhaps regret measures, such as choosing a decision with minimum regret (Moallemi, Elsawah, and Ryan 2019).</li>
<li>Justify or otherwise explain how you chose these measures and determined performance criteria in relation to the analytical objectives, model purpose and modelling context, such as the risk attitudes of decision-makers and stakeholders within this system.</li>

<h1>2.0 Define Conceptual Model</h1>
<p>Conceptual models underpin the formal or quantitative model (Cartwright et al.&nbsp;2016). The conceptual model describes the biological mechanisms relevant to the ecological problem and should capture basic premises about how the target system works, including any prior knowledge and assumptions about system processes. Conceptual models may be represented in a variety of formats – such as influence diagrams, linguistic model block diagram or bond graphs – illustrating how model drivers are linked to both outputs or observed responses, and internal (state) variables (Jakeman, Letcher, and Norton, 2006).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-exploration-or-preliminary-data-analyses">2.4.3 Data Exploration or preliminary data analyses</h3>
<p>It is often necessary when modeling to perform preliminary analyses to check assumptions and ensure requirements of the chosen modelling procedure are met, for instance, exploratory analyses to check for collinearity, spatial and temporal coverage, quality and resolution, outliers or the need for transformations (Yates et al.&nbsp;2018, White et al.&nbsp;2019).

<section id="model-class-framework-and-approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-class-framework-and-approach">3.1 Model Class, Framework and Approach</h2>
<p>Modelling approaches lie on a spectrum from correlative or phenomenological to mechanistic or process-based (Yates et al.&nbsp;2018); where correlative models use mathematical functions fitted to data to describe underlying processes, and mechanistic models explicitly represent processes and details of component parts of a biological system that are expected to give rise to the data (White and Marshall 2019). A model ‘class,’ ‘family’’ or ‘type’ is often used to describe a set of models each of which has a distinct but related sampling distribution (Liu &amp; Aitken, 2008). The model family is driven by choices about the types of variables covered and the nature of their treatment, as well as structural features of the model, such as link functions, spatial and temporal scales of processes and their interactions (Jakeman et al.&nbsp;2006).</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe what modelling framework, approach or class of model you will use to implement your model and relate your choice to the model purpose and analytical objectives described in 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.</li>

<li>a trend,</li>
<li>a long-term mean,</li>
<li>a probability distribution,</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Provide a rationale for your choices, including why plausible alternatives were not chosen.</li>

<p>This section refers to the process of determining the best/most efficient/parsimonious representation of the system at a scale relevant to the model purpose, context and scope appropriate scale of concern (Jakeman, 2006) that best meets the analytical objectives (as specified in 1.1.3). Approaches to finding model structure and parameters may be knowledge-supported, or data-driven (Boets et al.&nbsp;2015). Model selection methods can include traditional inferential approaches such as unconstrained searches of a dataset for patterns that explain variations in the response variable, or use of ensemble-modelling methods (Barnard et al.&nbsp;2019). Ensemble modelling procedures might aim to derive a single model, or a multi-model average (Yates et al.&nbsp;2018). Refining actions to develop a model could include iteratively dropping parameters or adding them, or aggregating / disaggregating system descriptors, such as dimensionality and processes (Jakeman, 2006). - Specify what approach and methods you will use to identify model structure and parameters.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qualitative-model-checking">4.3.2 Qualitative model checking</h3>
<p>This step is largely informal and case-specific but requires ‘face validation’ with model users / clients / managers who aren’t involved in the development of the model to assess whether the interactions and outcomes of the model are feasible and defensible (Grimm et al.&nbsp;2014). Other terms for qualitative checking include the “laugh test” or the “pub test,” and in addition to checking the model’s believability, they build the client or users’ confidence in the model (Jakeman, Letcher, and Norton 2006).</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain how you will qualitatively check the model, and whether and how you will include users and clients in the process. Face validation could include structured walk-throughs, or presenting descriptions, visualisations or summaries of model results to experts for assessment.</li>
</ul>

<section id="assumption-violation-checks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assumption-violation-checks">4.3.3 Assumption violation checks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain how you will demonstrate robustness to model assumptions and check for violations of model assumptions.</li>
<li>If you cannot perform quantitative assumption checks, describe what theoretical justifications would justify a lack of violation of or robustness to model assumptions.</li>
<li>If you cannot demonstrate or theoretically justify violation or robustness to assumptions, explain why not, and specify whether you will discuss assumption violations and their consequences for interpretation of model outputs.</li>
<li>The consequences of assumption violations on the interpretation of results should be assessed (Araújo et al.&nbsp;2019). If assumption violations cannot be avoided, explain describe how you will explore their consequences (To be completed in interim iterations of the preregistration, only if there are departures from assumptions as demonstrated in the planned tests above).</li>

<h1>5.0 Model Validation and Evaluation</h1>
<p>Model evaluation including model analysis and other testing complements model checking. By evaluating the model against independent test or holdout data the chance that the model fits the calibration or fitting data well, but has not captured the relevant ecological mechanisms of the system, can be ruled out (Grimm et al.&nbsp;2014). Collectively, modelling activities in section 4 and 5 provide provide information about the structural realism and therefore credibility of the model (Grimm et al.&nbsp;2014).</p>
<section id="model-output-corroboration" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-output-corroboration">5.1 Model output corroboration</h2>
<ul>
<li>State whether you will corroborate the model outputs on external test data, and ensure that any independent validation data is documented in 4.1.2.</li>
<li>Testing the model against data that are collected spatially and/or temporally independent from the training dataset minimizes the risk of artificially inflating model performance measures (Araújo et al.&nbsp;2019). Although the corroboration of model outputs against an independent validation dataset is considered the ‘gold standard’ for showing that a model properly represents the internal organisation of the system), model validation is not always possible (Grimm, et al.&nbsp;2014). If you are unable to evaluate the model outputs against independent data, explain why not, and describe what steps you will take to interrogate the model. For example, Independent predictions can instead be tested on submodels, alternatively, patterns in model output that are robust and seem characteristic of the system can be identified and evaluated in consultation with the literature or by experts to judge how accurate the model’s output is (Grimm et al.2014).</li>
</ul>
<section id="model-corroboration-performance-metrics-and-criteria" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-corroboration-performance-metrics-and-criteria">5.1.1 Model corroboration performance metrics and criteria</h3>
<ul>
<li>Specify what performance measures you will use to evaluate the model and briefly explain how each test relates to different desired properties of a model’s performance. Examples include measures of agreement between predictions and independent observations, or estimates of accuracy, bias, calibration, discrimination refinement, resolution and skill (Araújo et al.&nbsp;2019).</li>
<li>Spatial, temporal and environmental pattern of errors and variance can change the interpretation of model predictions and conservation decisions (Araújo et al.&nbsp;2019), where relevant and possible, describe how you will characterise and report the spatial, temporal and environmental pattern of errors and variance.</li>
<li>If comparing alternative models, specify what measures of model comparison or out-of-sample performance metrics will you use to find support for alternative models or else to optimise predictive ability.</li>
<li>State what numerical threshold or qualities you will use for each of these metrics.</li>

<section id="uncertainty-analyses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uncertainty-analyses">5.2.1 Uncertainty Analyses</h3>
<p>Uncertainty can arise from different modeling techniques, response data and predictor variables (Araújo et al.&nbsp;2019). Uncertainty analyses characterise the uncertainty in model outputs, and identify how uncertainty in model parameters affects uncertainty in model output, but does not identify which model assumptions are driving this behaviour (Grimm et al.&nbsp;2014; Saltelli et al.&nbsp;2019).</p>
<ul>
<li>Please describe how you will characterise model and data uncertainties. E.g. propagating known uncertainties through the model, investigating the effect of different model scenarios with different parameters and modelling technique combinations (Araújo et al.&nbsp;2019), or empirically constructing model distributions from model output datapoints, and extracting summary statistics, including the mean, median, variance, and constructing confidence intervals (Saltelli et al.&nbsp;2019).</li>
<li>Relate your choice of analysis to the context and purposes of the model described in the problem formulation phase. For instance, high model precision may be important for predictive modelling when cost, benefit and risk must be adequately gauged, but for decision-making contexts where only the predicted ranked order of management options is necessary, model accuracy and precision might be less important (Jakeman, Letcher, and Norton 2006).</li>
<li>Describe how you will summarise the results of these in silico experiments with graphical, tabular, or other devices, such as summary statistics.</li>
<li>If the chosen modelling approach is able to explicitly articulate uncertainty due to data, measurements or baseline conditions, such as by providing estimates of uncertainty (typically in the form of probabilistic parameter covariance, (Jakeman, Letcher, and Norton 2006)), specify which measure of uncertainty you will measure.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sensitivity-analyses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sensitivity-analyses">5.2.2 Sensitivity Analyses</h3>
<p>Sensitivity analysis examines how uncertainty in model outputs can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in model input (Saltelli et al.&nbsp;2019).</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the sensitivity analysis approach you will take: deterministic sensitivity, stochastic sensitivity (variability in the model), or scenario sensitivity (effect of changes based on scenarios).</li>
<li>Describe any sensitivity analyses you will conduct by specifying which parameters will be held constant, which will be varied, and the range and intervals of values over which those parameters will be varied.</li>
<li>State the primary objective of each sensitivity analysis, for example, to identify which input variables contribute the most to model uncertainty so that these variables can be targeted for further data collection, or alternatively to identify which variables or factors contribute little to overall model outputs, and so can be ‘dropped’ from future iterations of the model (Saltelli et al.&nbsp;2019).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="model-application-scenario-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-application-scenario-analysis">5.2.3 Model application / scenario analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Specify any input conditions and relevant parameter values for initial environmental conditions and decision-variables under each scenario specified in section 1.</li>
<li>Please describe any other relevant technical details of model application, such as methods for how you will implement any simulations or model projections.</li>
<li>What raw and transformed model outputs will you extract from the model simulations or projections, and how will you map, plot, or otherwise display and synthesise the results of scenario and model analyses.</li>
<li>Explain how you will analyse the model analysis output to answer your analytical objectives. For instance, describe any trade-off or robustness analyses you will undertake to help evaluate and choose between different alternatives in consultation with experts or decision-makers.</li>
